"""Marked Lines module takes the transcript df as an inpurt. Each row is a line 
in the transcript. It is used to find when vocab is used, appropriate phrases 
are used, and if a teacher talks more than 3 times in row. Then the column
"marked_lines" is updated, which indicators attached to it. For example if 
a teacher used vocab, then --VOCAB is added at the end so that when pasting it
into Openpyxl, the script knows to make that line blue."""
