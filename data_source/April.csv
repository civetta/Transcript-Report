Ms. Crystal @ [2018-04-27T17:20:55.843Z]: Yes it is smaller! We can think of multiplying fractions as taking a fraction of a fraction.  For example is 2/3 x 3/4  greater than 1?
Logan @ [2018-04-27T17:21:17.316Z]: yes
Ms. Crystal @ [2018-04-27T17:21:27.464Z]: Think of 3/4.  Is that bigger or less than 1?
Logan @ [2018-04-27T17:21:33.607Z]: less
Ms. Crystal @ [2018-04-27T17:21:45.426Z]: 3/4 is less than 1, so if you take a part of 3/4 away (like you do with the 2/3) then you will have less than 1.
Logan @ [2018-04-27T17:22:08.150Z]: ok
Ms. Crystal @ [2018-04-27T17:22:38.013Z]: 2/3 x 3/4 is the same as saying '2/3 of 3/4' and since 3/4 is less than 1, taking 2/3 away from it gives an answer less than 1.

Mr. Tino @ [2018-04-27T13:02:22.645Z]: Yes, and what did you do to get 8?

Mr. Tino @ [2018-04-27T13:02:57.697Z]: I agree partially.
Mr. Tino @ [2018-04-27T13:03:19.831Z]: Alice has 7 more than 1. So Alice = 7 + 1. In other words, Alice = 7 + the amount Bob has.

Mr. Tino @ [2018-04-27T13:07:30.470Z]: Mr. Tino has 3 more than Keyaira. So Mr Tino's amount = 11 + the amount Keyaira has

Desha @ [2018-04-27T17:19:55.246Z]: The $2.80 goes along with the $4 cause it says plus the $2.80

Mr. Tino @ [2018-04-27T15:41:29.652Z]: Yes, 12 - 3 - 3 - 3 - 3 = 0. So 12 ÷ 3 =4 because we can subtract 3 from 12 a total of 4 times.

Mrs. Nicole @ [2018-04-28T01:54:54.731Z]: If the total elapsed time was 59 minutes, and the signal took 9.5 minutes each way, how can we find the robot's travel time?
Abigail @ [2018-04-28T01:55:27.010Z]: by adding
Mrs. Nicole @ [2018-04-28T01:56:05.614Z]: can you see how the whole 'elapsed time' is 59 minutes?
Abigail @ [2018-04-28T01:56:12.151Z]: yea
Mrs. Nicole @ [2018-04-28T01:56:56.732Z]: if we need to take off the signal time from the total time, what math operation would that mean?
Abigail @ [2018-04-28T01:57:16.694Z]: subtraction
Mrs. Nicole @ [2018-04-28T01:57:46.053Z]: right, if we start with the elapsed time, we have to subtract the signal time
Mrs. Nicole @ [2018-04-28T01:57:54.032Z]: how many signal times do we have to subtract?
Abigail @ [2018-04-28T01:58:08.440Z]: 2
Mrs. Nicole @ [2018-04-28T01:58:22.269Z]: yes, so we can subtract 2 x signal time
Abigail @ [2018-04-28T01:58:31.495Z]: ok
Mrs. Nicole @ [2018-04-28T01:59:03.348Z]: that gives us the robot's actual driving time for the bottom of the division
Mrs. Nicole @ [2018-04-28T01:59:40.660Z]: Do you see the 'a/b' button on your calculator?
Abigail @ [2018-04-28T02:00:24.093Z]: yes the fraction ?
Mrs. Nicole @ [2018-04-28T02:00:51.072Z]: yes! If you click that, it will give you the long fraction bar like I have on the whiteboard
Abigail @ [2018-04-28T02:01:14.562Z]: ok did it
Mrs. Nicole @ [2018-04-28T02:01:40.908Z]: great, so you can build the equation just like we did on the whiteboard
Abigail @ [2018-04-28T02:02:59.457Z]: alright is that all

Anaya @ [2018-04-27T18:34:26.815Z]: The question is asking me to find Habib's error 0.34&gt; 1/2 because 0.34=3/4
Anaya @ [2018-04-27T18:35:25.949Z]: we just started the basics of decimals in my class, i get that part but i'm having trouble comparing them with fractions.
Mrs. Richardson @ [2018-04-27T18:35:49.112Z]: Not a problem, I am here to help!
Mrs. Richardson @ [2018-04-27T18:35:58.139Z]: Did you know decimals and fractions are the same thing, written a different way?

Anaya @ [2018-04-27T18:37:09.102Z]: But the comparing part is hard for me
Mrs. Richardson @ [2018-04-27T18:38:27.298Z]: Think of decimals as fractions, that have 100 as their denominator.
Mrs. Richardson @ [2018-04-27T18:38:32.962Z]: .50 is equivalent to 50/100
Mrs. Richardson @ [2018-04-27T18:39:01.219Z]: .25 is the same as 25/100
Anaya @ [2018-04-27T18:39:54.547Z]: Ok , but what about when you have something like 3/5 would it be 30/100 ?
Anaya @ [2018-04-27T18:40:08.310Z]: or 30/50
Mrs. Richardson @ [2018-04-27T18:40:23.563Z]: Awesome awesome question!!!
Mrs. Richardson @ [2018-04-27T18:40:48.165Z]: So you need to find an equivalent fraction, that has 100 as it's denominator. ^_^
Mrs. Richardson @ [2018-04-27T18:40:56.407Z]: Do you remember to find equivalent fractions?
Anaya @ [2018-04-27T18:41:13.539Z]: yes!
Mrs. Richardson @ [2018-04-27T18:41:38.805Z]: Awesome! So 3/5 is equvialent to 30/50. How can I re-write 30/50 with 100 as it's denominator?
Anaya @ [2018-04-27T18:43:04.029Z]: 30/100???
Anaya @ [2018-04-27T18:43:30.626Z]: wait i think its 80/100
Mrs. Richardson @ [2018-04-27T18:43:46.789Z]: So close! It's 60/100!
Mrs. Richardson @ [2018-04-27T18:43:53.543Z]: 30/50 x 2/2 = 60/100

Roosegerly @ [2018-04-27T12:45:35.301Z]: because 0.05 is equal to 0.50 and 0.50 is greater than 0.23
Ms. Sara @ [2018-04-27T12:45:59.093Z]: 0.05 and 0.50 are NOT equal to each other.

Ms. Sara @ [2018-04-27T12:47:23.550Z]: So 0.05 is LESS than 0.23.
Roosegerly @ [2018-04-27T12:47:32.770Z]: yeah
Ms. Sara @ [2018-04-27T12:47:42.689Z]: 0.02 + 0.03 is LESS than 0.23

Roosegerly @ [2018-04-27T12:51:11.123Z]: So if 0.5 = 0.50 then is 0.05 greater than or less than 0.50

Brenda @ [2018-04-27T15:11:52.097Z]: because in the problem it says Andrew has 2 boxes of crards
Mrs. Jen @ [2018-04-27T15:12:41.313Z]: 2 *boxes* is not the same as 2 cards though.
Mrs. Jen @ [2018-04-27T15:12:55.390Z]: It says each box has 6 cards in it, so then how many cards do you think Andrew has?
Brenda @ [2018-04-27T15:13:11.090Z]: 6
Mrs. Jen @ [2018-04-27T15:14:03.610Z]: that would be just 1 box of cards = 6 cards.

Mrs. Jen @ [2018-04-27T17:08:18.822Z]: 1/4 would mean 1 shaded blue, out of 4 total to make the whole
Mrs. Jen @ [2018-04-27T17:08:28.234Z]: But how can you show one whole as a fraction with all four parts blue?

James @ [2018-04-27T14:56:35.388Z]: Because the bigger one is a multiple of two and the smaller one is halved.
Mrs. Lisa @ [2018-04-27T14:57:26.245Z]: Right

Nevaeh @ [2018-04-27T13:47:12.692Z]: okay
Nevaeh @ [2018-04-27T13:48:27.719Z]: 2 4 8 28 are all factors of 28?
Mrs. Kay @ [2018-04-27T13:48:43.831Z]: 8 is not a factor of 28
Nevaeh @ [2018-04-27T13:48:49.516Z]: oh
Mrs. Kay @ [2018-04-27T13:48:55.404Z]: But can you show me how 4 is a factor of 28?
Nevaeh @ [2018-04-27T13:49:28.681Z]: because 4x7=28. oooh so 7 is a factor of 28 too not 8

Nevaeh @ [2018-04-27T13:51:02.312Z]: is 8 a factor of 19?

Mrs. Kay @ [2018-04-27T13:51:42.833Z]: 8 x _ = 19 can you think of a number that goes in the blank?
Nevaeh @ [2018-04-27T13:52:22.390Z]: is 8x2 16?
Nevaeh @ [2018-04-27T13:52:47.204Z]: i think the answer is 8x3=19
Mrs. Kay @ [2018-04-27T13:52:56.830Z]: Does 16 + 8 equal 19?
Nevaeh @ [2018-04-27T13:53:08.327Z]: nope
Mrs. Kay @ [2018-04-27T13:53:11.809Z]: So then 8 x 3 does not equal 19

Nevaeh @ [2018-04-27T13:53:18.454Z]: dang it

Mrs. Kay @ [2018-04-27T13:53:27.303Z]: Are either of those a factor of 19?
Nevaeh @ [2018-04-27T13:53:38.561Z]: no
Mrs. Kay @ [2018-04-27T13:53:58.046Z]: So then you can pick *not a factor* for both of those :)
Nevaeh @ [2018-04-27T13:54:37.971Z]: so there is NO CORRECT number to finish it off?
Nevaeh @ [2018-04-27T13:54:46.576Z]: the answer is NO?
Nevaeh @ [2018-04-27T13:55:04.677Z]: okay i dont understand
Mrs. Kay @ [2018-04-27T13:55:25.952Z]: The only factors of 19 are 1 and 19
Nevaeh @ [2018-04-27T13:55:47.886Z]: so there are only 2 numbers in 19?
Mrs. Kay @ [2018-04-27T13:55:58.209Z]: 19 has 2 factors
Nevaeh @ [2018-04-27T13:56:05.302Z]: right

Ms. Nicole @ [2018-04-27T16:28:18.343Z]: Lets take a look at the glossary on the right side of the screen.
Ms. Nicole @ [2018-04-27T16:28:28.066Z]: Look up the word **origin** and tell me what it means in your own words?
Destiny @ [2018-04-27T16:31:22.715Z]: In two dimensions. On the flat coordinate plane, there are two axes, the vertical y-axis and the horizontal x-axis. The origin is the point where they intersect. This point has the coordinates 0,0 and is usually labelled with the letter O.
Ms. Nicole @ [2018-04-27T16:32:12.594Z]: Awesome! :)
Ms. Nicole @ [2018-04-27T16:32:58.712Z]: so if x =0 and y = 0 and you double them both to make them have direct variation, what would the new point be?

Ms. Caren @ [2018-04-27T15:45:04.230Z]: ok so how is 2 x y different from y x 2?
Miranda @ [2018-04-27T15:45:33.146Z]: and and you have to multiply y x y and you have to multiply y twice but you do not know what y is so you cannot solve it
Miranda @ [2018-04-27T15:46:24.735Z]: and if y was 2 it would be four

Ms. Caren @ [2018-04-27T15:56:32.070Z]: Ok but is that the circles in the 1st row, the circles in the 2nd row or all of the circles?
Miranda @ [2018-04-27T15:56:50.184Z]: all of them
Ms. Caren @ [2018-04-27T15:57:19.118Z]: Ok how did you get 5 for all of them?

Ms. Caren @ [2018-04-27T15:58:16.795Z]: Ok so let's go back...how many circles are in the 1st row?
Miranda @ [2018-04-27T15:58:53.187Z]: 3...... 1,2,3
Miranda @ [2018-04-27T16:00:16.730Z]: the second row is 2... 1,2
Ms. Caren @ [2018-04-27T16:00:44.949Z]: Ok so what would you do with 3 and 2 to get the total circles?
Miranda @ [2018-04-27T16:00:47.388Z]: :(
Miranda @ [2018-04-27T16:01:07.357Z]: you add
Ms. Caren @ [2018-04-27T16:01:34.755Z]: Great! So 3c + 2 c = 5c. Does that make sense?

Miranda @ [2018-04-27T16:02:22.882Z]: why did I add circles
Ms. Caren @ [2018-04-27T16:03:46.355Z]: Because that was my example. We used circles which can be the same thing as using variables. So 3 circles + 2 circles = 5 circles is the same as 3c + 2c = 5c.

Adelina @ [2018-04-27T23:12:56.171Z]: Ok
Ms. Erin @ [2018-04-27T23:13:34.580Z]: So to add these we need to find a common denominator and we already said that in could be 100 right?
Adelina @ [2018-04-27T23:13:45.789Z]: Yep
Ms. Erin @ [2018-04-27T23:14:03.033Z]: To find an equivalent fraction you can multiply the numerator and the denominator of the fraction by the same number ok?
Adelina @ [2018-04-27T23:15:02.732Z]: Ok
Adelina @ [2018-04-27T23:15:25.180Z]: So the denominator is 100 in this example
Ms. Erin @ [2018-04-27T23:15:37.859Z]: Yes, so what did we multiply 10 by to get to 100?
Adelina @ [2018-04-27T23:15:47.239Z]: 10
Ms. Erin @ [2018-04-27T23:16:13.844Z]: Right, so we need to do the same think to the numerator in order to keep the fraction equivalent to 2/10.
Adelina @ [2018-04-27T23:16:26.188Z]: ok
Ms. Erin @ [2018-04-27T23:16:32.310Z]: What would you get?
Adelina @ [2018-04-27T23:16:49.264Z]: So you put 2 times 10 that’s 20
Ms. Erin @ [2018-04-27T23:16:55.108Z]: Right!
Ms. Erin @ [2018-04-27T23:16:59.573Z]: So what is our new fraction?
Adelina @ [2018-04-27T23:17:20.829Z]: 20/100
Ms. Erin @ [2018-04-27T23:17:26.643Z]: Yes good!
Ms. Erin @ [2018-04-27T23:17:32.312Z]: What should we do with that now?
Adelina @ [2018-04-27T23:17:42.384Z]: Simplify?
Ms. Erin @ [2018-04-27T23:18:01.457Z]: Well do we have a common denominator now?
Adelina @ [2018-04-27T23:18:28.236Z]: Oh do we do 20/100 plus 30/100
Ms. Erin @ [2018-04-27T23:18:31.928Z]: Great thinking!
Ms. Erin @ [2018-04-27T23:18:35.325Z]: What would you get?
Adelina @ [2018-04-27T23:18:51.094Z]: 50/100
Ms. Erin @ [2018-04-27T23:18:57.454Z]: Awesome!
Ms. Erin @ [2018-04-27T23:19:00.764Z]: See if you can use what we did to try this on your own.
Adelina @ [2018-04-27T23:19:42.552Z]: Ok so for 1/10 I’d get 10/100 then add them together and get 80/100 sooooo.... 80/100 is my answer right?
Ms. Erin @ [2018-04-27T23:19:52.031Z]: I think you have it from here! Keep up the awesome work!

Ella @ [2018-04-27T15:33:31.955Z]: I learned that the 40 was on the top and 12 on the side so you would add
Ella @ [2018-04-27T15:33:45.406Z]: The question ask what formula would you use
Mrs. Jen @ [2018-04-27T15:34:25.399Z]: Adding would find the sum of the sides but not quite what the question is. What does 12 represent to Gloria?

Koski @ [2018-04-27T12:38:58.102Z]: It is outside of the rectangle region so the figures don’t have 4 right angles

Ms. Crystal @ [2018-04-27T12:41:38.680Z]: very good and what else did our helps say was special about this shape?
Koski @ [2018-04-27T12:43:39.474Z]: That if a rhombus has 4 right angles then it is also a square which makes it a rectangle too
