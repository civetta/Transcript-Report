Carlos @ [2018-09-19T17:52:28.818Z]: type
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:52:46.934Z]: Ok! Let's get started!
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:53:09.112Z]: Let's talk about the word equivalent!
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:53:15.784Z]: Any idea what that might mean?
Carlos @ [2018-09-19T17:53:27.133Z]: noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:53:44.682Z]: Well, that is a good place to start then! : )
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:54:04.615Z]: Equivalent sounds a lot like another word we use in math- equal!
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:54:13.634Z]: What does equal mean?
Carlos @ [2018-09-19T17:54:21.163Z]: smae
Carlos @ [2018-09-19T17:54:25.738Z]: same
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:54:28.533Z]: Yep!
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:54:38.578Z]: If something is equivalent, it has the same value!
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:54:43.506Z]: It's worth the same amount!
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:54:55.467Z]: 10 pennies is equivalent to 1 dime.
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:54:58.461Z]: Make sense?
Carlos @ [2018-09-19T17:55:04.425Z]: yesssssssss
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:55:21.147Z]: Great! So...what is the value of 3 x 4?
Carlos @ [2018-09-19T17:55:40.536Z]: 16
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:56:04.404Z]: Check your facts if you need to and try again! I know you've got this!
Carlos @ [2018-09-19T17:56:06.975Z]: 12
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:56:11.040Z]: YES!
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:56:49.135Z]: So... 3 x 4 is equivalent to 12
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:57:01.747Z]: is 3 x 4 equivalent to 2 x 6?
Carlos @ [2018-09-19T17:57:17.872Z]: 12
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:57:37.573Z]: Yes! Both have a value of 12, so they are equivalent!
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:57:42.205Z]: Let's go back to the problem here!
Carlos @ [2018-09-19T17:58:06.335Z]: okay
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:58:20.392Z]: What is the value of 2 x 4 + 4?
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:58:55.237Z]: solve it for me!
Carlos @ [2018-09-19T17:59:32.539Z]: 15

Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:38:44.832Z]: Let's take a look!
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:39:07.859Z]: When we say something is proportional, can you explain in your own words what proportional means?
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:40:23.771Z]: I really like the octopus example in your hints by the way! : )
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:40:27.600Z]: It helps me visualize
Jaquelyn @ [2018-09-19T17:40:40.599Z]: it is  something that have the same ratios,size or amount
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:40:47.351Z]: that is true!
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:41:07.976Z]: so, no matter how many times the quantity changes, the ratio is still the same.
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:41:34.190Z]: So...1 octopus has 2 eyes for every 8 arms.
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:41:37.929Z]: 2/8
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:42:02.899Z]: what do 2 octopus have? what is the ratio there?
Jaquelyn @ [2018-09-19T17:42:51.860Z]: 4 eyes for every 16 arms so 4/16
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:43:11.290Z]: yes! Is 2/8 equal to 4/16? Is it proportional?
Jaquelyn @ [2018-09-19T17:43:20.156Z]: yes
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:43:54.395Z]: You are right! They key is that no matter how many octopus we add, this will remain constant.
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:44:10.459Z]: There will not all of a sudden be an octopus with 3 eyes : )
Jaquelyn @ [2018-09-19T17:44:27.978Z]: right
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:44:41.710Z]: So, looking at your answer choices here, which of these scenarios will remain consistent no matter what?
Jaquelyn @ [2018-09-19T17:45:33.179Z]: your seed while riding a roller coaster
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:46:32.973Z]: Does the rate of speed change on a roller coaster?
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:46:41.582Z]: Think about going up a hill vs. going down a hill
Jaquelyn @ [2018-09-19T17:46:54.447Z]: oh
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:47:09.899Z]: right! It's not a constant, unchanging rate of speed.
Jaquelyn @ [2018-09-19T17:47:34.975Z]: a car ride at a constant rate speed of 25 mph for 8 mins/
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:47:40.534Z]: Bingo!
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:47:48.214Z]: That is the only constant rate given
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:48:12.539Z]: so the proportion between time and distance will always remain the same, no matter how many miles we travel!
Jaquelyn @ [2018-09-19T17:48:19.569Z]: yes
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:48:39.530Z]: I think you are ready to tackle the next one on your own! What do you think?

Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-18T17:51:36.650Z]: One way we can think about fractions is to break a whole into pieces!
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-18T17:51:47.604Z]: Pizza is easy to think about : )

Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-18T17:52:20.024Z]: If we eat 5 of them, have we eaten half of the pizza?
Emma @ [2018-09-18T17:53:03.606Z]: No ma'm if the Pizza was 10 peices we would have ate half of the pizza 12 is not 10 and 10 is not 12
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-18T17:53:31.825Z]: Very good! So we know that 5/12 is LESS THAN 1/2.
Emma @ [2018-09-18T17:53:41.445Z]: YE$
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-18T17:53:51.407Z]: Now, what if we had 10 slices, and ate 7? Less than or more than half?
Emma @ [2018-09-18T17:54:06.370Z]: More then Half
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-18T17:54:27.617Z]: Yes! So, that is one way we can compare two fractions as given in this problem!
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-18T17:54:34.579Z]: Which fraction is greater?

Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-17T18:08:14.034Z]: Yes! So, looking at this problem, what do you notice about the first two factors in each picture?
Stephan @ [2018-09-17T18:08:34.096Z]: They both include a 7
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-17T18:09:22.504Z]: These problems both do have 7 as one factor. What do you notice about the 3 and 6, and thinking about the title of this lesson!
Stephan @ [2018-09-17T18:09:44.415Z]: One has 3x7 and 6x7
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-17T18:10:26.321Z]: Yes- let's break apart 6! What two numbers can we multiply to get 6?

Stephan @ [2018-09-17T18:11:15.965Z]: Sorry pressed it too fast i meant 3 and 2
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-17T18:11:45.818Z]: Yes! 6 is 3 doubled, or multiplied by 2!

Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-17T18:12:30.879Z]: Can you see even by looking at the picture, that the dots in the 2nd are exactly double of the dots in the first  pic?

Leah @ [2018-09-17T17:55:57.296Z]: i always get confused with the signs
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-17T17:56:27.810Z]: Awesome, Leah! That is aok! Is that where you want to begin? Reviewing greater than/less than signs?
Leah @ [2018-09-17T17:56:37.065Z]: yes
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-17T17:57:44.450Z]: Great- since I was a kid, I always saw the greater than, or less than sign as a crocodile mouth. The crocodile always has his mouth open to the greater/bigger number. I know it's silly, but it has stuck with me! Have you every visualized it that way?
Leah @ [2018-09-17T17:58:07.187Z]: no
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-17T17:58:35.987Z]: Can you see what I mean by the 'mouth' opening to the greater number?

Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-17T17:59:19.815Z]: Great. Now, let's look at our problem again! We know you have to make at LEAST how much money to buy your jeans?
Leah @ [2018-09-17T17:59:31.973Z]: 45
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-17T17:59:54.529Z]: Right. Greater than or equal to $45!
Leah @ [2018-09-17T18:00:02.142Z]: yep
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-17T18:00:35.242Z]: We want x+ 20 to be 'greater than or equal to' 45.
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-17T18:00:44.157Z]: WOuld you like to draw which sign that would be?
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-17T18:01:30.732Z]: Yes, Leah!
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-17T18:01:38.583Z]: That is perfect!
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-17T18:01:42.746Z]: Think you can take it from here?

Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T16:44:27.603Z]: First of all, can you tell me in your own words what this problem is trying to find?
Samantha @ [2018-09-19T16:45:36.154Z]: How much bigger is the area from the new phone screen than the old phone screen
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T16:46:06.352Z]: Exactly! The difference in area!
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T16:46:34.827Z]: So, how would you solve this problem?
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T16:46:49.651Z]: How do we find area?
Samantha @ [2018-09-19T16:47:28.921Z]: We would find the area by multpling
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T16:48:06.176Z]: Yep! Can you tell me a little more about that? What two numbers are we multiplying&gt;
Samantha @ [2018-09-19T16:48:42.061Z]: The length and width
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T16:49:15.032Z]: Great! In this case, the height and width of phone!
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T16:49:56.970Z]: Would you change anything about your original answer so far?
Samantha @ [2018-09-19T16:50:34.069Z]: I don't think so
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T16:51:32.143Z]: Originally, I see that you may have chosen the following equation- new screen height - current screen height = difference of area. Is this correct? Why or why not? I think you are ready to explain!
Samantha @ [2018-09-19T16:53:39.450Z]: Oh no it is not correct because i had to multiply the height and the width of all of them.
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T16:53:56.711Z]: Aha! Yes, good catch!
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T16:54:06.173Z]: I think you are ready to try on your own from here!

Clayton @ [2018-09-19T17:12:43.283Z]: i am confused
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:12:44.660Z]: First of all, we are going to choose 'factor pairs' for 84.
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:13:00.052Z]: Factor pairs are simply any two numbers that when multiplied, equal 84!
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:13:04.509Z]: Does that part make sense?

Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:14:05.651Z]: OK, so now, we are going to weed out the factor pairs that do not contain just composite numbers! Let's look at 2 x 42!

Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:15:30.586Z]: Let's try that again! What are two numbers we can multiply to get an answer of 2?
Clayton @ [2018-09-19T17:15:47.720Z]: 1x2
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:15:50.388Z]: Yes!

Clayton @ [2018-09-19T17:16:07.033Z]: no
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:16:23.141Z]: RIGHT! We call that a PRIME number. It is NOT a composite number.
Ms. Desiree @ [2018-09-19T17:16:29.501Z]: Does that make sense?
Clayton @ [2018-09-19T17:16:36.599Z]: no
