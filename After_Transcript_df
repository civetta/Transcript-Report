Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:57:54.361Z]: yes or to see how two or more things are similar or different
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:58:03.171Z]: so what is being compared here

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:59:40.986Z]: ok so what do we know about the dimensions?

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:02:08.835Z]: i think it would easier to see in an example so Let's take a look at an example together.
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:03:37.964Z]: so the red square is 1/2 the scale of the white square

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:04:19.899Z]: and how can i prove that with the measurements given?
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:04:47.393Z]: by multiplying?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:05:13.640Z]: ok can you say more about that?
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:05:32.718Z]: and by dividing?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:06:39.262Z]: thats a start!
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:07:00.129Z]: so just by looking at the lengths, how do they compare?
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:07:53.960Z]: 4 is a multiple of 2
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:08:03.067Z]: 10 is a multiple of 5
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:08:47.858Z]: yes and we also that 5 is half of 10 right
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:08:55.905Z]: and 2 is half of 4
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:09:07.121Z]: so the scale proportion is 1/2
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:09:18.123Z]: we can prove this mathematically too!
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:09:27.819Z]: yes
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:09:56.924Z]: so that means that the red shape is half of the white one
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:10:19.198Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:10:31.111Z]: and 1/2 is the scale proportion
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:11:03.012Z]: so when the problem shares the word 'scale' it means what proportion of the orginial it is
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:11:11.771Z]: does that make sense?
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:11:24.140Z]: kinda
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:11:40.888Z]: ok so lets switch the numbers a little
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:11:46.052Z]: 1/2 was kinda easy
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:11:53.877Z]: ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:12:19.372Z]: lets say the red square is 1/3 of the white square
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:12:39.803Z]: so i need to know what is 1/3 of the dimensions then correct?
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:13:00.831Z]: yes

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:33:47.410Z]: Did you hear my voice?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:34:38.905Z]: what are factors?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:35:53.239Z]: yes, they are numbers like a first factor is the first number in a probem
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:36:18.381Z]: ok so what is the job of a factor?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:37:04.237Z]: do not understand
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:37:16.058Z]: Please look up words you are unfamiliar with in the glossary you have been provided. :)
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:37:22.777Z]: like factors :)
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:37:30.906Z]: i did
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:37:45.820Z]: ok so what did your definition say?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:39:32.347Z]: a whole number muitply by one or more whole number
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:39:50.589Z]: Fantastic thinking! yay!
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:40:06.780Z]: thx
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:40:26.658Z]: now can factors be prime, composite or both?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:44:31.290Z]: no because they are each different suff
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:44:57.143Z]: hi
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:45:01.335Z]: hello
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:45:03.903Z]: Can you say more about how you got that?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:45:05.108Z]: hi'
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:45:10.664Z]: ok
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:47:09.950Z]: they are because they each have different meaning
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:47:29.979Z]: ok so what is a prime number?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:48:52.648Z]: a whole with 2 factor
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:49:11.359Z]: not quite but you can look up what prime means
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:50:49.511Z]: i did
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:51:02.606Z]: ok so what is a prime number?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:53:07.633Z]: a whole number with two factors and 1 is not a prime number because it is only one number
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:53:20.967Z]: super!
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:53:49.599Z]: so lets compare numbers 1, 2 , and 4
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:53:59.856Z]: how many factors make up the 1?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:55:24.709Z]: 0
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:56:31.191Z]: well remember what factors are: 2 numbers multiplied to get a product
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:56:49.332Z]: 1
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:57:33.972Z]: ok so really 1 has a factor 1  and itself right?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:57:42.333Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:58:14.570Z]: ok so what kind of number is 1
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:58:55.733Z]: not a prime numbers
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:59:21.095Z]: ok can you explain not?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:59:58.115Z]: i mean it is not a prime number
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:00:31.317Z]: Fantastic thinking! 1 is unique so it is not considered a prime number. what other numbers are prime?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:00:58.410Z]: 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:01:43.484Z]: Not quite, but good effort! Let's work together to figure this out.
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:01:59.079Z]: lets establish some clarifications
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:02:21.894Z]: wait 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:04:30.345Z]: ok so how are you getting these numbers? what is your reasoning?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:06:21.333Z]: because it says 1 is not a prime number
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:06:49.697Z]: ok but we need to know why :)
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:07:25.899Z]: so what are the factors of 2?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:08:20.628Z]: 1
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:09:04.481Z]: 2 x 1 = 2
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:09:11.331Z]: are there any other factors of 2?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:09:25.925Z]: 2
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:09:54.017Z]: ok what other factor goes with 2 ?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:10:14.156Z]: 4
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:11:05.037Z]: so you are saying that there is 4 x ? = 2
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:11:26.841Z]: n0
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:11:44.432Z]: ok so the only true factors of 2 are 2x1
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:11:51.994Z]: does that make sense?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:12:05.549Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:12:21.016Z]: so lets categorize it on the whiteboard
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:12:33.614Z]: what about 3
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:12:43.703Z]: what factors when multiplied = 3?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:13:37.995Z]: do not have one
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:14:09.865Z]: what do you mean by that?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:14:49.666Z]: i do not have a answer
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:15:09.167Z]: ok so you still dont know what factors are do you?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:15:14.989Z]: you can be honest
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:16:09.751Z]: i do not what they are
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:16:39.042Z]: ok lets use an example on the white board
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:16:47.324Z]: ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:16:58.579Z]: what number do you see?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:16:58.591Z]: 8
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:17:04.182Z]: great!
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:17:10.766Z]: 4 2
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:17:14.296Z]: 8 is the product or the answer to a multiplication problem
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:17:34.012Z]: the 4 and 2 are the factors
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:17:44.912Z]: o
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:18:13.057Z]: ok so
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:18:27.877Z]: now we can also classify numbers into two groups
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:18:35.803Z]: do they have it in eyery problem
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:18:55.105Z]: yes every NUMBER can be either composite or prime
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:18:59.471Z]: does that make sense
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:19:11.999Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:20:08.526Z]: ok so now are there any other factos for 8?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:20:31.469Z]: 4 2 2 4
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:21:01.054Z]: yes but essentially they are the same numbers right?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:21:05.298Z]: how about 8x1
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:21:24.655Z]: yea
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:22:13.414Z]: ok so because eight has 2 pairs of factors it is COMPOSITE
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:22:22.182Z]: does that make sense?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:23:14.140Z]: yes thank you have a great night

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:19:39.718Z]: Did you hear my voice?
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:19:44.645Z]: No
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:19:51.888Z]: HOW ABOUT now?
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:20:09.490Z]: Well no but i guess you could type
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:20:31.215Z]: ok so what does perimeter mean?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:20:43.460Z]: the space around or the space inside a shape?
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:20:56.254Z]: Its the outside of a figure
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:21:14.891Z]: becouse area is the inside of a figure
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:21:21.896Z]: or shape
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:21:24.312Z]: Wow! I am impressed on how you thought about that! :)
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:21:41.504Z]: thanks
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:21:49.688Z]: what do you think the perimeter of the photo is?
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:22:24.799Z]: i dont get you?
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:22:34.089Z]: like what do you mean?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:22:51.917Z]: what is the perimeterof the photo in the problem?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:22:57.590Z]: it tells u in the problem
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:23:04.916Z]: oh
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:24:34.650Z]: Well i know that right now its 6 but if you add 2 on each of the other sides the total is 10?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:24:51.847Z]: Fantastic thinking!
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:24:56.745Z]: :)
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:25:04.636Z]: you figured it out!!
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:25:12.385Z]: so the answer is 2
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:25:22.999Z]: ?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:25:40.044Z]: yes and how would you use it in a perimeter equation?
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:26:14.525Z]: 6+2=10 perimeter?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:26:27.158Z]: 6+2=8
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:26:38.316Z]: yeah thats what i meant sorry
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:26:42.854Z]: rememeber the formula for perimeter?
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:26:49.163Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:26:54.984Z]: what is it?
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:27:25.760Z]: it would be 3+2=5 and then again 3+2=5 so 5+5=10?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:28:01.572Z]: yes exactly
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:28:12.373Z]: ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:28:14.893Z]: 2 x length + 2 x width = perimeter
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:28:22.985Z]: Yeah
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:28:39.356Z]: so 2 ( 3) + 2 ( 2) = 10
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:29:05.033Z]: Yes so the answer is 2 Thankyou Ms.Johana! :)
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:29:15.026Z]: Please come back if you need more help. Have a nice day!

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T00:07:21.127Z]: Hi! Let's look over your problem again. Would you like me to type or talk?
Gianna @ [2018-05-11T00:07:41.020Z]: type
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T00:07:57.782Z]: how do you subtract fractions?
Gianna @ [2018-05-11T00:08:41.722Z]: by adding the whole  number to the fraction
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T00:09:40.815Z]: ok Can  you prove that maybe in an example?
Gianna @ [2018-05-11T00:11:00.708Z]: if you have 2 and 1/5 if you add two fives then it will equal 10/5
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T00:11:33.250Z]: ok can you show me in numbers too so i can follow you?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T00:13:45.964Z]: ok i understand the bottom :)
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T00:14:05.567Z]: 10/5- 5/5 = 5/5
Gianna @ [2018-05-11T00:14:24.592Z]: the part i dont understand is how to subtract it with a different denominator
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T00:14:42.261Z]: ok
Gianna @ [2018-05-11T00:14:50.798Z]: i can subtract with a even denominator
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T00:14:52.520Z]: but the first part i dont get
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T00:15:02.266Z]: 5/5+5/5 = 1/5
Gianna @ [2018-05-11T00:15:25.283Z]: 5/5 +5/5 are both the two wholes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T00:15:36.048Z]: yes but you said 1/5
Gianna @ [2018-05-11T00:15:59.861Z]: oh
Gianna @ [2018-05-11T00:16:45.393Z]: i didnt add 1/5
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T00:16:55.156Z]: oh ok
Gianna @ [2018-05-11T00:17:33.832Z]: 5/5 + 5/5 + 1/5
Gianna @ [2018-05-11T00:17:42.196Z]: 11/5
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T00:18:04.801Z]: nice!
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T00:18:32.282Z]: ok so now can you make a subtraction equation that relates to this?
Gianna @ [2018-05-11T00:18:52.635Z]: uh i dont know
Gianna @ [2018-05-11T00:19:27.104Z]: how do i subtract uneven denominators
Gianna @ [2018-05-11T00:19:36.829Z]: i just dont get it
Gianna @ [2018-05-11T00:21:11.552Z]: 2  1/3- 5/7 is it 2/7
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T00:21:33.615Z]: well i would like for to just focus on the families
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T00:21:44.427Z]: meaning all parts of the fractions must be included
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T00:21:52.595Z]: Let's take a look at an example together.
Gianna @ [2018-05-11T00:22:06.764Z]: ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T00:23:12.174Z]: now i am going to make a subtraction related it to it
Gianna @ [2018-05-11T00:24:23.038Z]: ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T00:24:44.951Z]: do you see how i created a fact family using the sums and the differences?
Gianna @ [2018-05-11T00:25:01.162Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T00:25:31.156Z]: ok so The concept that you need to see is that fact familes can exist in fractions as well as whole numbers
Gianna @ [2018-05-11T00:25:56.455Z]: but they have the same denominators
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T00:26:50.832Z]: yes they do but you have to be able to compare the value of the fractions
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T00:26:55.519Z]: do you know how to do that?
Gianna @ [2018-05-11T00:27:07.080Z]: yes

ISABELA @ [2018-05-08T22:03:00.466Z]: you have to make your whole number into a fraction
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T22:03:27.300Z]: ok show me what mean by that?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T22:03:33.962Z]: Do you see the whiteboard?

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T22:09:42.095Z]: we why do we have to flip them?
ISABELA @ [2018-05-08T22:10:59.778Z]: Because you have to multiply them?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T22:11:00.339Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T22:11:12.962Z]: no we dont flip once we multiply

ISABELA @ [2018-05-08T22:26:29.603Z]: It equals 2whole
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T22:27:42.308Z]: not quite, please try again. Think about the question one more time :)
ISABELA @ [2018-05-08T22:28:13.735Z]: I don’t know??
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T22:28:31.220Z]: well we know we know 2 halves make 1 whole
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T22:28:46.134Z]: then if we add 1 more half, what does it make together?
ISABELA @ [2018-05-08T22:28:57.954Z]: 4
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T22:29:53.953Z]: do you see my blue sentence?

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-10T22:50:10.699Z]: and those symbols allow you to compare both sides of the equation

RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:23:14.588Z]: type or talk witch ever works for you
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:23:26.965Z]: lets type
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:23:31.462Z]: ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:23:35.359Z]: how can i help?
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:24:35.111Z]: i dont know exactly how to get the answer for the last problem 4/6=blank then i have to fill in the blank
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:24:49.459Z]: oh ok
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:24:55.302Z]: and it has to be in fraction form
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:25:26.633Z]: so how did you think about the others you got correcT&gt;
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:26:35.298Z]: it gave me one of the numbers so  i figured out how they got it and the way i thought they got the other number i used to get the number i needded
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:27:05.164Z]: Way to pay attention to those clues!
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:27:23.556Z]: so now in the last one, what can help you regarding the denominator?
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:28:32.465Z]: it didnt give me any numbers thats why  need  help cause i dont know what to multiply by
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:29:00.946Z]: ok so lets make some observations based on the other equivalent fractions
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:29:16.759Z]: for example
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:29:22.213Z]: Do you see the whiteboard?
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:29:49.905Z]: yess
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:30:03.566Z]: how are 3 and 6 similar?
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:30:21.208Z]: you multiply by 2??
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:31:00.187Z]: yes! perfect! so 6 is part of the 3 multiple family
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:31:22.825Z]: yep
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:32:02.078Z]: one observation is that in order to have equivalent fractions, the numerators have to share a common multiple
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:32:06.545Z]: does that make sense?
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:32:38.037Z]: kinda could you explain a little more please
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:32:41.859Z]: sure
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:33:06.004Z]: thank you
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:33:26.579Z]: the green numbers are all multiples
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:33:38.993Z]: do you see that?
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:34:10.876Z]: yes and the red numbers are what you multiplying by right
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:34:45.684Z]: well the red number is the number family
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:35:01.053Z]: it is what you are skip counting by
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:35:07.114Z]: oh
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:35:18.166Z]: 3,6,9,12,
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:35:31.948Z]: then what comes next if we are skip counting by 3?
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:35:55.493Z]: 15,18,21,24,27
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:36:09.202Z]: Fantastic thinking! those multiples could go on and on!
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:36:29.509Z]: now when we compare fractions the numerators have to share a common multiple
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:36:39.546Z]: which we decided was 6
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:37:19.016Z]: would we multiply by 6 then
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:37:22.628Z]: are you with me?
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:37:33.597Z]: yepp
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:37:41.616Z]: well how did you think about multiplying by six?
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:38:55.361Z]: cause  both 3 and 6 have a multiple of 6
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:39:34.007Z]: ok i see! but actually we would find the factor that would could use to relate the two numbers
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:40:02.401Z]: what do u mean by relate
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:40:16.588Z]: what numbers 3 x ? = 6
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:40:24.152Z]: 2
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:40:37.572Z]: super that is called the common factor
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:40:48.723Z]: oh ok.
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:41:13.303Z]: so what we do to the NUMERATOR with the common factor we have to also do to the DENOMINATOR
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:41:52.218Z]: And thats a way we can get equivalent fractions
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:41:53.753Z]: find common factors ?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:42:10.207Z]: well common multiples
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:42:27.297Z]: then fill in the factors to make the equation true
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:42:49.479Z]: so lets try the bottom one and walk me thru it
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:43:26.538Z]: whats your first thought?
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:44:36.686Z]: i honestly  cant remember much after like 5 minutes thats why i need extra help in math cause i have difficulties understanding it
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:44:49.218Z]: Please give it a try! It is okay to make mistakes.
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:45:19.158Z]: would we multily by 2
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:45:26.749Z]: ***multiply
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:45:59.705Z]: ok so essentially we would just be doubling the fraction right when we multiply by 2 right?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:46:07.985Z]: we can do that :)
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:46:21.329Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:46:40.283Z]: so we have to do the same to the top
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:46:46.683Z]: 8/12
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:46:52.881Z]: wu/
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:46:55.354Z]: is that the answer
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:46:56.758Z]: I think you have it from here! Keep up the awesome work!

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:19:51.521Z]: do you know what reducing or simplifying means?
Bushra @ [2018-05-09T01:20:33.449Z]: i dont wat simplifying means
Bushra @ [2018-05-09T01:21:19.178Z]: oops i meant i dont KNOW wat simplifying means
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:21:35.488Z]: ok it means to make a fraction less complicated but still equal in value
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:21:37.974Z]: Let's take a look at an example together.
Bushra @ [2018-05-09T01:21:54.133Z]: ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:23:00.126Z]: i can simplify this fraction on the white board
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:23:28.300Z]: meaning I can find a less complicated fraction that is equal to it if i find a common reducing factor
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:23:32.725Z]: does that ring a bell?

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:00:03.136Z]: Hi! Let's look over your problem again. Would you like me to type or talk?
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:00:14.287Z]: type
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:00:38.109Z]: ok so what is the equation of  a circle?
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:01:14.847Z]: (x-h)^2+(y-k)^2
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:01:22.045Z]: i think
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:01:51.935Z]: how did you find that equation?
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:02:15.147Z]: because my geo teacher taught me
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:02:17.833Z]: memory
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:02:53.938Z]: ok so what equation is described in the problem?
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:03:55.928Z]: x^2+y^2-4x+2y=4
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:04:55.369Z]: ok great! so the question asks which of the given choices represents the SAME x^2+y^2-4x+2y=4?
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:05:32.112Z]: I'm lost
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:06:07.852Z]: ok Let's take a look at an example together.
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:06:19.145Z]: ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:06:21.516Z]: Do you see the whiteboard?
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:06:43.944Z]: yes ma'am
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:07:00.730Z]: can you write an equivalent equation?
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:07:20.346Z]: x^2+2^2
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:07:27.549Z]: ..?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:07:37.146Z]: well not quite
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:07:50.718Z]: since I am squaring the expression then it would be represented as such
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:08:28.928Z]: ok
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:08:46.474Z]: like foil
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:08:53.639Z]: yes
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:09:21.333Z]: ok so what now?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:11:04.559Z]: ok so now we have to relate the same concept to what the problem is asking
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:11:45.893Z]: so if the question is asking that equation represents a circle, then one of the given choices is equal to it
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:11:50.734Z]: does that make sense?

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:21:40.662Z]: what does the first statement mean to u?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:22:03.775Z]: Make the statement in simple words :)
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:22:07.472Z]: Numbers
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:22:10.871Z]: nothing
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:22:34.552Z]: I don't see how I can relate that to an equation of a circle
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:24:07.982Z]: ok well in the example they give you, they want you to know what a standard form of the equation looks like
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:24:56.863Z]: meaning that within this equation you find the center of the circle and the radius
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:24:56.916Z]: ohh looking at two different things
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:25:12.492Z]: ok can you say more about that?
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:25:42.397Z]: I was looking at where it says example. That equation.
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:25:52.514Z]: oh ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:26:03.551Z]: yes but the statement above it is also helpful
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:26:20.345Z]: no they take the Example equation and they start to break it down
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:26:24.051Z]: what do they do first?
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:27:09.109Z]: I have no clue... Where did the 9 come from?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:27:36.999Z]: good question about the 9! lets think about this
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:27:52.763Z]: what does it mean to complete the square?
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:28:52.127Z]: to like answer it?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:29:14.570Z]: yes

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:31:28.115Z]: so why would you need a 3? show me on the whiteboard
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:32:10.039Z]: because if you complete the square to get 9 you need a 3
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:33:52.095Z]: yes but remember that x^2 is the same as what?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:34:06.372Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:34:45.693Z]: but when you complete the square, what do you get?
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:35:15.322Z]: I don't know what x is
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:35:22.958Z]: (x)(x)

Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:14:42.938Z]: can you let me show you what it equals
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:14:50.336Z]: sure
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:15:42.338Z]: there
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:16:02.515Z]: Not quite, but good effort! Let's work together to figure this out.
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:16:08.077Z]: ok
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:16:42.830Z]: so what do we do?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:17:22.275Z]: first we have to multiple the denominator with the whole number
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:17:26.171Z]: its gonna be 15
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:17:40.003Z]: yes i know this part
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:17:44.744Z]: super!
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:17:56.407Z]: so how did you get that?
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:18:19.344Z]: i got 15/10 becouse
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:19:01.438Z]: i multiply 1 and 10 wich equals 10 +5 equels 15
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:19:20.224Z]: and we leave the denominator the same
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:19:23.392Z]: super!
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:20:36.064Z]: so how can you apply this strategy with this problem
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:22:07.116Z]: i just dont know on the problem what mixed number im suppose to turn into a fraction.
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:22:47.035Z]: well first you have to identify the mixed numbers
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:22:52.854Z]: so lets look at the first one
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:22:59.709Z]: ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:23:01.713Z]: what is the mixed number?
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:23:32.958Z]: 2 3/12
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:25:06.153Z]: 2 3/12 right
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:25:16.577Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:25:46.459Z]: so how would you make it into a fraction like you just showed me?
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:25:53.319Z]: the total is going to be 27/12
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:25:58.999Z]: right
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:26:34.460Z]: perfect!!
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:26:41.725Z]: now I think you have it from here! Keep up the awesome work!
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:26:47.851Z]: Please come back if you need more help. Have a nice day!

Evolet @ [2018-05-08T15:08:01.577Z]: yes
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:09:03.935Z]: So if we have 8 total parts... and we know to have 1 whole, we need 4 parts, how many wholes can we make?
Evolet @ [2018-05-08T15:09:20.127Z]: 4??

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:32:31.543Z]: How many acres does it say there are in **total**?
Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:33:01.146Z]: 3
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:33:09.336Z]: How many acres are there in the first 4 lots in total?
Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:33:35.227Z]: 7/4
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:33:48.058Z]: Not exactly, what math can we use to find out?
Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:34:03.484Z]: Addition
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:34:06.936Z]: What will we add?

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:34:50.560Z]: Awesome, what does that equal?

Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:35:50.915Z]: No
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:35:55.883Z]: right! How is that more or less than 2 wholes

Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:36:31.942Z]: Sorry
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:36:33.502Z]: Is it more than 2 wholes?
Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:36:38.653Z]: No
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:36:53.495Z]: what does the 4 in 9/4 tell us?
Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:37:18.991Z]: Total parts in one whole
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:37:55.850Z]: Yes, so if we have **9**/4... can we make more than 1 whole?
Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:38:09.090Z]: Yes
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:38:55.687Z]: can we make more than 2 wholes?
Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:39:11.488Z]: No
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:39:37.965Z]: but we know that the 4 tells us how much makes up 1 whole, right
Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:39:45.631Z]: Yes
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:39:58.898Z]: And 4/4 is 1 whole.... what fraction is the same as 2 whoels?
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:40:00.701Z]: wholes*
Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:41:18.794Z]: ummmmmmmm...

Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:41:50.927Z]: It’s hard
Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:42:10.683Z]: I don’t know
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:42:23.941Z]: Do you see that **8**/4 would be the same as 2 wholes?
Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:42:33.677Z]: No
Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:42:41.468Z]: How
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:43:30.955Z]: the 4 tells us how many parts will make up 1 whole. So **4**/4 tells us we have 4 parts out of 4 parts... good so far?
Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:44:34.912Z]: Oh I get it because 4+4=8 two wholes would be 8/4
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:44:59.820Z]: Right! :)
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:45:05.025Z]: So then is 9/4 more or less than 8/4?
Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:45:33.182Z]: More so it is bigger than two wholes

Jayla @ [2018-05-09T21:56:49.899Z]: type so the frist ones are ones right
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:57:15.881Z]: why do you think that? :)
Jayla @ [2018-05-09T21:58:17.171Z]: can you see what im working on
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:58:28.700Z]: Yes
Jayla @ [2018-05-09T21:59:06.488Z]: so you see what i put
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:59:34.105Z]: I can only see what you have when you clicked in
Jayla @ [2018-05-09T22:00:45.990Z]: so you can't see my math problem
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:01:10.132Z]: I can see the problem, but only the answer you had when you clicked in
Jayla @ [2018-05-09T22:01:28.926Z]: oh
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:01:51.678Z]: Why do you think the first answers are ones?
Jayla @ [2018-05-09T22:02:41.548Z]: yes so  the 8 in 18 i in the ones place
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:03:48.755Z]: Right, what if we had 150 ÷ 3... how many groups of 15 can we make?
Jayla @ [2018-05-09T22:04:23.251Z]: 5
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:04:35.182Z]: Not exactly, try again :)
Jayla @ [2018-05-09T22:04:59.244Z]: 10
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:05:47.950Z]: Right! :) So if we have groups of 15... how many will go in each of 3 groups?
Jayla @ [2018-05-09T22:06:26.839Z]: 5
Jayla @ [2018-05-09T22:06:39.004Z]: or 10
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:06:58.700Z]: Which one?
Jayla @ [2018-05-09T22:07:07.022Z]: 1

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:08:07.872Z]: Do you see that we can can make 3 groups of 50 to get 150?
Jayla @ [2018-05-09T22:09:32.232Z]: this is hard i give up
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:09:59.650Z]: Don't give up! :)Think of it this way:  How many groups of 10 make up 150?
Jayla @ [2018-05-09T22:10:38.148Z]: 3
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:10:54.532Z]: Not exactly, if you break 150 into groups of 10, how many can you make?
Jayla @ [2018-05-09T22:11:37.694Z]: 15
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:11:46.661Z]: Right! :) So if we split the 15 tens into groups of 3, how many tens will be in each group?
Jayla @ [2018-05-09T22:13:13.182Z]: 5
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:13:31.682Z]: Great! :) So then 150 ÷ 3 is the same as 5 tens or 50. make sense?
Jayla @ [2018-05-09T22:14:31.717Z]: im ok whit it

Jolie @ [2018-05-08T15:40:57.131Z]: Just a pilot :D
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:41:22.369Z]: LOL! Oops! The rest of my question didn't send :)
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:41:26.394Z]: What are you asked to find out about the miles?
Jolie @ [2018-05-08T15:44:09.717Z]: To find the nearest thousand. :&gt;
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:44:33.641Z]: Right! :) Why do you think your choice was incorrect?
Jolie @ [2018-05-08T15:46:01.848Z]: Because I got it wrong. :.(
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:46:07.999Z]: but why?
Jolie @ [2018-05-08T15:46:40.326Z]: i was working it out and then i got the wrong answer
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:47:33.242Z]: you can think of **rounding** as skip counting. for example, if you count by 10's, what will be closest to 193 ? *...0, 10, 20, 30, ...*
Jolie @ [2018-05-08T15:48:02.099Z]: 40 50 60 70 80 90 100!!!!1
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:48:28.798Z]: That does not answer my question, please read it carefully :)
Jolie @ [2018-05-08T15:49:20.368Z]: 190? :/
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:49:58.886Z]: Right :) If we count by 10's to round to the nearest ten, what would be count by to round to the nearest thousand?
Jolie @ [2018-05-08T15:50:26.861Z]: 100?
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:50:31.700Z]: Please think about what we just talked about :)
Jolie @ [2018-05-08T15:51:15.451Z]: i kinda dont get it
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:51:31.274Z]: Do you see that to round to the nearest ten, we counted by 10's?
Jolie @ [2018-05-08T15:51:42.499Z]: ya
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:52:02.604Z]: So what would we count by if we are rounding to the nearest thousand?
Jolie @ [2018-05-08T15:52:19.056Z]: 1,000

Balqees @ [2018-05-09T23:15:59.196Z]: type please
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T23:16:01.191Z]: let's try a simple example to help. what would 2•5 + 2•3 equal ?
Balqees @ [2018-05-09T23:16:16.957Z]: 15
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T23:16:28.467Z]: Not exactly, try again :)
Balqees @ [2018-05-09T23:16:29.669Z]: am I right?
Balqees @ [2018-05-09T23:16:33.274Z]: awe man
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T23:16:42.931Z]: Give it another try :)
Balqees @ [2018-05-09T23:17:12.803Z]: 1 4/15
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T23:17:42.716Z]: To solve 2 • 5 + 2 • 3, what do we need to do first?
Balqees @ [2018-05-09T23:18:20.566Z]: um..
Balqees @ [2018-05-09T23:18:25.249Z]: you have to solve
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T23:18:32.349Z]: How?
Balqees @ [2018-05-09T23:18:50.326Z]: I'm not exactly sure I forgot...
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T23:19:02.182Z]: What does 2• 5 mean?
Balqees @ [2018-05-09T23:19:28.538Z]: my teacher said it mean multiply
Balqees @ [2018-05-09T23:19:33.714Z]: meant***
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T23:19:38.639Z]: Right! So what does that equal?
Balqees @ [2018-05-09T23:19:42.260Z]: 10
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T23:19:49.578Z]: Right, and then 2 • 3?
Balqees @ [2018-05-09T23:19:56.625Z]: 6
Balqees @ [2018-05-09T23:20:02.886Z]: OHHH

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T23:20:08.946Z]: Right! :)
Balqees @ [2018-05-09T23:20:14.471Z]: I am so sorry
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T23:20:22.872Z]: do you see something that is the same in both addends here for 2•5 + 2•3 ?
Balqees @ [2018-05-09T23:20:34.049Z]: the 2
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T23:20:50.008Z]: if we remove the 2 from both addends, what would be left?
Balqees @ [2018-05-09T23:21:03.720Z]: the 5 and 3
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T23:21:18.609Z]: and do 5 and 3 together make the original 16?
Balqees @ [2018-05-09T23:21:27.729Z]: no
Balqees @ [2018-05-09T23:21:31.875Z]: it makes 15
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T23:21:45.716Z]: 5 + 3?
Balqees @ [2018-05-09T23:22:10.210Z]: Oh I thought you meant as in multiplication
Balqees @ [2018-05-09T23:22:14.487Z]: it makes 8
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T23:22:42.342Z]: Right! so you see, 2•5 + 2•3 is the same as 2•(5 + 3) = 16. does that make a little more sense?
Balqees @ [2018-05-09T23:22:59.714Z]: yea a bit
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T23:23:08.191Z]: Did you know that you can use that same thinking here?

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:34:40.615Z]: here's a small example to help you with this problem. what does 10 - 8 = ?
Lexi @ [2018-05-08T14:35:59.660Z]: 2
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:36:05.875Z]: how can you use math to check that 10 - 8 = 2 ?
Lexi @ [2018-05-08T14:36:20.753Z]: you add 2 plus 8
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:36:39.312Z]: so if 10 - 8 = 2, then 2 + 8 = 10. some people refer to this as a 'fact' or 'fact family,' okay?
Lexi @ [2018-05-08T14:36:52.711Z]: Okay.
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:37:15.554Z]: Did you know that you can use that same thinking here?
Lexi @ [2018-05-08T14:37:46.565Z]: Yes, and I've tried using the method, but it won't work!
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:38:01.872Z]: why

Lexi @ [2018-05-08T14:38:26.275Z]: I don't know, it's just hard
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:38:50.389Z]: if 10 - n = 8, then what is another fact we can say?
Lexi @ [2018-05-08T14:39:34.860Z]: N plus 8 will equal 10?
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:40:18.752Z]: Great! :) so then what has to be true about the sum of the answer Natasha has and 5/7?
Lexi @ [2018-05-08T14:40:44.564Z]: It has to equal 1 and 1/3.
Lexi @ [2018-05-08T14:40:58.483Z]: I mean 2 and 1/3&gt;

Aubrey @ [2018-05-08T15:49:36.286Z]: 18/18
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:50:08.509Z]: Not exactly, try again :)
Aubrey @ [2018-05-08T15:50:52.362Z]: I'm not sure.
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:51:06.686Z]: Remember that fractions show us **parts/total parts** Okay?
Aubrey @ [2018-05-08T15:51:57.574Z]: Yes.
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:52:27.713Z]: Now, what *fraction* would mean the same as just **1 part** here?
Aubrey @ [2018-05-08T15:52:46.056Z]: I know the shape has 18 squares and 10 squares are shaded red.
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:53:01.299Z]: But if we have just 1 shaded part, what fraction would it be?
Aubrey @ [2018-05-08T15:54:16.132Z]: 1/18
Aubrey @ [2018-05-08T15:54:57.389Z]: I was thinking about the whole of the shape and not the parts. Now I understand.
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:55:25.601Z]: Great! :) Now, think about what fraction would represent all of the shaded parts here :)
Aubrey @ [2018-05-08T15:55:55.286Z]: Would that be the whole?
Aubrey @ [2018-05-08T15:56:05.282Z]: 10/18

Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-08T19:22:14.634Z]: This question asks us to estimate... what does that mean?
Cody @ [2018-05-08T19:22:36.617Z]: To estimate
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-08T19:22:44.392Z]: Let's use a similar example
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-08T19:23:10.588Z]: Which of these would have the larger answer?
Cody @ [2018-05-08T19:23:50.263Z]: Decry
Cody @ [2018-05-08T19:24:06.294Z]: The one on the right
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-08T19:24:32.500Z]: You've got it!
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-08T19:24:59.905Z]: When we estimate up and down... what does this tell us about where our answer should be?
Cody @ [2018-05-08T19:26:01.198Z]: Down
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-08T19:26:38.995Z]: estimating down will give us a smaller number, yes :)  We know our answer will need to be somewhere between 2 and 12 then, is that right?
Cody @ [2018-05-08T19:27:20.482Z]: Right
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-08T19:27:40.412Z]: awesome!  your problem works the same way :) See if you can use what we did to try this on your own.
Cody @ [2018-05-08T19:29:18.184Z]: Wait

Cody @ [2018-05-08T19:32:28.108Z]: Help
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-08T19:33:03.946Z]: When we estimate up, what whole numbers would we be multipllying with?
Cody @ [2018-05-08T19:34:01.162Z]: The numbers
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-08T19:34:25.137Z]: which numbers?
Cody @ [2018-05-08T19:35:49.678Z]: 5
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-08T19:36:25.501Z]: Great, since 5 is **less** than 5.78, I know I'm going to get a smaller answer
Cody @ [2018-05-08T19:36:49.632Z]: And 1
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-08T19:37:30.000Z]: That's right :)  again, this is smaller than 1.18 so we know our answer for will be effected :)
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-08T19:37:33.942Z]: See if you can use what we did to try this on your own. You are doing a great job! Time to work on your own.

Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T18:58:13.756Z]: Hi! Let's look over your problem again. Would you like me to type or talk?
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T18:58:27.574Z]: hello Mrs. Kathryn
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T18:58:33.569Z]: What does a denominator tell us about our whole amount?
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T18:58:45.120Z]: ummm
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T18:58:54.961Z]: whatt
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T18:59:02.725Z]: do you mean
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T18:59:03.764Z]: Can you please shade half of this?
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T18:59:10.498Z]: halh\
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T18:59:13.967Z]: halh
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T18:59:17.128Z]: half
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T18:59:18.967Z]: i mean
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T18:59:21.100Z]: me
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T18:59:28.874Z]: okay get readyy
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T18:59:30.440Z]: okay
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T18:59:44.174Z]: ready :)
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T18:59:51.850Z]: okay
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:00:20.219Z]: right :)  a denominator will tell us how many equal parts our whole is split into. Since our whole is split into 2 equal parts, our denominator has to be a 2.
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:01:38.317Z]: Let's try another example.  Please shade 2/8 for me
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:01:54.143Z]: okay
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:03:56.838Z]: If we had 2/8 used twice, would there be another way to solve it instead of repeated addition?
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:04:07.078Z]: ummmmm
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:04:17.624Z]: yeah what you are doing
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:04:24.588Z]: the smae thing
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:04:35.371Z]: and can you shade the boxes really fast
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:04:42.133Z]: and why is it blue
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:05:23.257Z]: ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:05:37.698Z]: If we wanted to use something other than repeated addition, what would we do?  Addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division?
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:06:08.960Z]: for example, if I had  2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10, would there be another way to solve it instead of repeated addition?
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:06:27.401Z]: wait can you answer my qustion
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:06:29.152Z]: plz
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:06:30.365Z]: plz
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:06:57.992Z]: can you shade the boxes really fast and why is it blue
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:07:03.188Z]: Yes, :)  the teachers have colors we can choose from
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:07:16.759Z]: oh can you put red i want to see it
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:07:27.938Z]: i never see it on think trought math
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:07:35.344Z]: through math i mean
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:07:51.225Z]: okay let get started
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:07:58.709Z]: Did you see my question above? for example, if I had 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10, would there be another way to solve it instead of repeated addition?
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:08:11.385Z]: yes
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:08:32.192Z]: Great, what could we do instead?
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:08:50.297Z]: you could Multiple
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:09:10.778Z]: perfect strategy :)
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:09:11.548Z]: 5x2

Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:10:46.229Z]: i dont get this that much bc i dont know how you got 2
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:10:51.508Z]: WHen you told me 2 x 5... how did you get the 5 ?
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:11:19.175Z]: wow thats just so rude
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:11:37.294Z]: I would like to help you. Are you ready to work on this together?
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:12:03.472Z]: i do to but not like you told i just fell like i just got rusted
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:12:41.266Z]: You're doing fine, let's just use what you told me to see how I got mine.  When we had 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 we said it was 2 x 5... where did the 5 come from?
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:14:10.121Z]: yeah but were did you get the 2 from
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:14:48.766Z]: The same way you got the 5 :)  when we adding two for 5 times, we multiply 2 x **5**.  In my example, how many times are we adding 2/8 ?
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:16:00.972Z]: no im  talkingy babo0u6t the4 5
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:17:56.518Z]: I'm not sure I understand that, can you explain your thinking to me?

Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-10T20:21:36.846Z]: Great to have you back Adeline :)  What does the word 'equivalent' mean to you?
ADELINE @ [2018-05-10T20:22:09.164Z]: eaqual to,no?
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-10T20:22:19.456Z]: perfect :) How do we make equal amounts? for example, 8 x __ = 8?
ADELINE @ [2018-05-10T20:23:40.518Z]: one! :) but i don't get what u said about 'how we make eaqual amounts?'  will u explain?
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-10T20:24:03.497Z]: You're right, that 8 x 1 = 8.  That's right, multiplying by 1 (or a form of 1, like 2/2 or 3/3 or 4/4, etc.) will make an equal amount
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-10T20:24:16.052Z]: what's a fraction that is the same as 1 whole?
ADELINE @ [2018-05-10T20:25:03.577Z]: 4-4ths,3-3ds,8-8ths,and so on
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-10T20:25:41.279Z]: That's perfect, let's try multiplying with one of those forms of 1 whole to get an equivalent fraction to 1/2
ADELINE @ [2018-05-10T20:27:40.033Z]: but,mrs.leCroy said we should cross multiply,*woah,* 1 half,times 8 eaths,is.........arrgh,this is *SOOOO* confusing. oh,sorry i didnt mean to complain........
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-10T20:28:10.754Z]: Cross multiplying works for other things, but **not** for making equivalent fractions :)
ADELINE @ [2018-05-10T20:29:12.877Z]: how do i do that? we havent leqrnd this yet,and its almost staar!!!!! *WAS I SUPPOSED TO LEARN THIS ALREADY!?* sorry,but........was i?  :0
ADELINE @ [2018-05-10T20:29:31.366Z]: ohmigosh,that was rude,sorry.
ADELINE @ [2018-05-10T20:29:46.131Z]: ?
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-10T20:29:55.560Z]: You're doing fine :)  Just keep in mind that we're multiplying by a form of 1 whole :)
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-10T20:30:03.262Z]: when we multiply fractions we go straight across :)
ADELINE @ [2018-05-10T20:30:11.051Z]: what?
ADELINE @ [2018-05-10T20:30:35.370Z]: i mean,i don't understand,oops :)
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-10T20:30:45.036Z]: Let's try another one then :)
ADELINE @ [2018-05-10T20:30:54.609Z]: ok! :) thx
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-10T20:31:15.035Z]: Just like you said, we can make equal amounts by multiplying with 1.  What's a fraction that's a form of 1 whole?
ADELINE @ [2018-05-10T20:32:00.502Z]: their are lots,but my personal fav,is 4/4!  :)
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-10T20:32:10.209Z]: great, yes, any of them will work :)
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-10T20:32:33.429Z]: So when we multiply our two numerators, what's our new numerator?

Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-10T20:18:57.373Z]: Please tell me something you know from the problem.
LILA @ [2018-05-10T20:20:04.098Z]: I know that the problem is asking to drag each picture or equation to the right problem
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-10T20:20:22.241Z]: what does multiplication mean to you?
LILA @ [2018-05-10T20:22:21.155Z]: Multiplication means to get two numbers together by bassicly adding
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-10T20:22:43.786Z]: I like that idea.  What I hear you saying is that we can use repeated addition to had the same amount again and again, is that right?
LILA @ [2018-05-10T20:23:12.298Z]: Yes
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-10T20:23:41.847Z]: Awesome!  so if multiplication is repeated addition, how could we describe division?
LILA @ [2018-05-10T20:24:04.402Z]: I've had this problem so many times and i get it wrong everytime so that's why i need help
LILA @ [2018-05-10T20:25:12.822Z]: Division is instead of repeated addition, it's bassicaly repeated subtraction
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-10T20:25:25.275Z]: That's the best answer I've heard all day! Nice job Lila :)

Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T21:03:36.156Z]: Hi! Let's look over your problem again. Would you like me to type or talk?
ANGELINA @ [2018-05-09T21:03:41.423Z]: type
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T21:03:46.558Z]: This question asks us to estimate... what does that mean?
ANGELINA @ [2018-05-09T21:04:09.310Z]: to give a rough figure
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T21:04:35.551Z]: great thinking :)  Let's try that with our mixed numbers.  For example, what would be the nearest whole to 2 5/6 ?
ANGELINA @ [2018-05-09T21:06:04.570Z]: 3?
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T21:06:10.724Z]: You've got it!
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T21:06:30.608Z]: Okay we can say that we have about 3 wholes... if we ate 1 1/4, about how much did we eat?
ANGELINA @ [2018-05-09T21:07:39.726Z]: 7/4
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T21:07:53.823Z]: What math did you use to find that?
ANGELINA @ [2018-05-09T21:08:10.649Z]: estimation
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T21:08:33.067Z]: great plan :)  if we have 1 1/4, what whole number are we estimating it to be?
ANGELINA @ [2018-05-09T21:09:08.948Z]: 2?
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T21:09:55.322Z]: Let's check that out to see if it makes sense.  How would we figure out the amount of 4ths needed to make half?
ANGELINA @ [2018-05-09T21:12:29.682Z]: Not sure
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T21:12:44.415Z]: Sometimes drawing it out can help us see it better.
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T21:12:53.908Z]: Please cut this into 4ths
ANGELINA @ [2018-05-09T21:13:25.722Z]: How can i easre

ANGELINA @ [2018-05-09T21:13:53.128Z]: Okay

ANGELINA @ [2018-05-09T21:14:36.839Z]: Like That
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T21:15:08.897Z]: Great :)  okay, how many would we need to shade to show half?
ANGELINA @ [2018-05-09T21:16:02.112Z]: 2
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T21:16:41.106Z]: You've got it!  we know that 2/4 is the same as having Half.  So if we only have 1/4, what does that tell us about how we should round ?
ANGELINA @ [2018-05-09T21:16:57.721Z]: i Have to go

Shanika @ [2018-05-09T16:40:09.407Z]: type
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-09T16:40:13.456Z]: Let's take a look at an example together.
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-09T16:40:28.782Z]: 6 = 48 ÷ □ .... What number will make that true?
Shanika @ [2018-05-09T16:40:45.205Z]: i have three right  but i need help with the other three
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-09T16:41:09.707Z]: 6 = 48 ÷ □ ... How do we check our answer to a division problem?
Shanika @ [2018-05-09T16:41:35.857Z]: by seeing what is the missing number
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-09T16:42:05.786Z]: and how can you find that missing numbers?
Shanika @ [2018-05-09T16:42:43.265Z]: by dividing to get the missing number
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-09T16:43:07.291Z]: so what division will we solve to find 6 = 48 ÷ □ ?
Shanika @ [2018-05-09T16:43:19.204Z]: idk
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-09T16:43:33.639Z]: What operation 'undoes' division?

Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-09T16:44:41.512Z]: That's right, so think of it this way:
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-09T16:44:44.619Z]: 6 x ☐ = 48?
Shanika @ [2018-05-09T16:45:46.728Z]: idk
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-09T16:46:16.887Z]: think of your 6's multiplication facts

Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T15:07:01.327Z]: yes, so do you see they multiplied 3/4 x 2/2 to make 6/8?
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T15:07:06.144Z]: They used a form of 1 whole?
Jaxon @ [2018-05-09T15:07:25.183Z]: Ok
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T15:08:19.562Z]: in this problem....

Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-10T16:31:49.278Z]: Tell me how you got that?

Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-10T16:33:48.904Z]: So if the item cost $100.... you need to think about 80 parts.

Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-10T16:34:44.281Z]: It tells you that the sale price is 80%
Sandra @ [2018-05-10T16:34:50.963Z]: oh ok
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-10T16:34:58.722Z]: So if the item cost $100, the sale price is $80
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-10T16:35:08.537Z]: meaning the discount was only 20%
Sandra @ [2018-05-10T16:35:14.706Z]: oh ok

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T13:55:36.214Z]: So if I said a multiple of 10 is 20,  how can you prove that?
Nevaeh @ [2018-05-09T13:55:51.614Z]: because 10x2 is 20
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T13:56:23.991Z]: Exactly! So we use that number, in our case 10, and other whole numbers to multiply together to find multiples. Do you see that?

Nevaeh @ [2018-05-09T13:56:58.272Z]: yes i see

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T15:43:24.567Z]: Hello! Let's use another example to help us here. I bought $5 of supplies to start a lemonade stand. I made $20 from selling lemonade. How much money did I actually **profit**?
Isabella @ [2018-05-10T15:44:01.581Z]: $25?
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T15:44:14.235Z]: How did you find that?

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T15:44:48.142Z]: Why would you add?

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T15:46:26.064Z]: Right! So if I sold $20 and spent $5 on supplies, how can I find how much I **profited**?

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T15:47:16.838Z]: Ok! Why do you think we can subtract to find our profits?

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T15:08:18.799Z]: Hello! What are we trying to find here?
Cheyenne @ [2018-05-10T15:08:39.030Z]: how many centimeters to cut off
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T15:09:25.153Z]: Right! How can I find that using the information we have?
Cheyenne @ [2018-05-10T15:10:12.235Z]: you can tun the fraction into an in proper fraction
Cheyenne @ [2018-05-10T15:11:07.591Z]: say for instence we have 24/4 so we would divide 24 by 3 to get 6 then we divide it by 225?
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T15:12:11.740Z]: Let's think, if I have a board the is 20 feet long, but I need it to be 12 feet long, how can I find how much to cut off?
Cheyenne @ [2018-05-10T15:12:48.197Z]: 8 feet because 20 - 12 = 8
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T15:13:34.759Z]: Awesome! We can use subtraction to help us, do you see that?
Cheyenne @ [2018-05-10T15:14:22.161Z]: no because you cant subract a whole number by a fraction
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T15:15:00.277Z]: You can! But let's think, what do you notice about the units of the rope here?

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T15:16:17.146Z]: Not quite, do you see we have centimeters and meters given to us here?
Cheyenne @ [2018-05-10T15:16:42.929Z]: yes
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T15:17:07.714Z]: Right! So how can we find how many centimeters is 1 and 1/2 meters?
Cheyenne @ [2018-05-10T15:17:58.829Z]: we can divide centimeters by meters
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T15:18:06.383Z]: Can you say more about what you mean by that?
Cheyenne @ [2018-05-10T15:18:37.044Z]: like you van divide 225 by 1 1/2
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T15:19:02.717Z]: How would that convert 1 1/2 to centimeters?
Cheyenne @ [2018-05-10T15:19:29.184Z]: ther is 100 centimeters in 1 meter
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T15:20:49.199Z]: Awesome! So how can we show 1 and 1/2 in centimeters?
Cheyenne @ [2018-05-10T15:22:14.559Z]: 1 meter is 100 centimeters so in an 1/2 it will be 50 so we have 1 1/2 will be 150 in centemeters
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T15:22:56.665Z]: Perfect! Do you think you can use what we talked about and apply it to your problem?

Liliana @ [2018-05-07T22:40:01.983Z]: so is it 3x2x4
Liliana @ [2018-05-07T22:40:32.306Z]: 3x2+2x4
Liliana @ [2018-05-07T22:40:53.446Z]: yes

Liliana @ [2018-05-07T22:41:45.706Z]: 4
Liliana @ [2018-05-07T22:42:33.569Z]: add up all the sides 6,4,6,4
Liliana @ [2018-05-07T22:43:15.548Z]: i still don't get it
Liliana @ [2018-05-07T22:43:39.321Z]: huh
Liliana @ [2018-05-07T22:43:49.924Z]: ok
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-07T22:44:04.508Z]: If you had a piece of string that was 5 feet long and cut it into two pieces of 3 feet and 2 feet, how would you find the total length again?
Liliana @ [2018-05-07T22:44:15.718Z]: 5
Liliana @ [2018-05-07T22:44:34.746Z]: 2+3=5
Liliana @ [2018-05-07T22:45:28.192Z]: yes but what if theres more then 1 number
Liliana @ [2018-05-07T22:47:10.464Z]: i mean like there is 3 numbers like 3 4and 2 i dont remember the numbers
Liliana @ [2018-05-07T22:48:04.665Z]: say that again
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-07T22:48:50.528Z]: Remember, 3 and 2 here just represent the **length** broken into two pieces. So to find the total length, we can add the pieces back together. Do you see that?
Liliana @ [2018-05-07T22:49:15.279Z]: no can you tell me the answer
Liliana @ [2018-05-07T22:49:27.883Z]: this is really hard
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-07T22:49:28.222Z]: Do you see we showed that on the board?
Liliana @ [2018-05-07T22:49:33.518Z]: yes
Liliana @ [2018-05-07T22:49:49.605Z]: can you talk again
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-07T22:49:50.799Z]: So we had to add the parts of the length back together to find the total. Do you see that?
Liliana @ [2018-05-07T22:50:01.623Z]: kindoff
Liliana @ [2018-05-07T22:50:21.320Z]: so is it 5x4
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-07T22:50:41.739Z]: Yes! In order to find our total of 5 again since it's broken into pieces, we have to **add** 3 and 2. Do you see that?
Liliana @ [2018-05-07T22:50:49.964Z]: because 2+3=5 then times 4
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-07T22:50:55.282Z]: Perfect! Do you think you can use what we talked about and apply it to your problem?
Liliana @ [2018-05-07T22:51:19.785Z]: um im not sure
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-07T22:51:26.966Z]: You are doing a great job! Time to work on your own. Please come back if you need more help.

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-07T23:29:16.502Z]: Hi! Let's look over your problem again. Would you like me to type or talk?
Emanuel @ [2018-05-07T23:29:36.619Z]: type
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-07T23:29:39.020Z]: Hello! How can you explain what a **unit rate** is?
Emanuel @ [2018-05-07T23:30:20.234Z]: i dont know
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-07T23:30:40.927Z]: Please give it a try! It is okay to make mistakes.
Emanuel @ [2018-05-07T23:33:15.308Z]: i think it is by something like miles per 2 hours or some thing like that
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-07T23:35:16.354Z]: A unit rate is a rate where the second unit is **1**. Ok?
Emanuel @ [2018-05-07T23:35:29.834Z]: ko
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-07T23:35:49.384Z]: Great! So if I said I drive 100 miles in 4 hours, is that a unit rate?
Emanuel @ [2018-05-07T23:35:53.563Z]: sorry i mean ok
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-07T23:36:10.328Z]: So if I said I drive 100 miles in 4 hours, is that a unit rate?
Emanuel @ [2018-05-07T23:36:35.024Z]: no
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-07T23:36:52.989Z]: You're right! How can I change that to become a unit rate?
Emanuel @ [2018-05-07T23:38:19.649Z]: how many miles in 1 hour
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-07T23:39:16.963Z]: Awesome thinking! So how would I find that if I drive 100 miles in 4 hours?
Emanuel @ [2018-05-07T23:41:23.921Z]: how many hours in 1 mile them times that times 100
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-07T23:42:09.379Z]: Let's think about that, how many miles would I need to go each hour to have gone 100 miles in 4 hours?
Emanuel @ [2018-05-07T23:43:35.925Z]: 100
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-07T23:44:11.321Z]: That means I would have gone 400 miles in 4 hours, does that match what we have?
Emanuel @ [2018-05-07T23:44:28.374Z]: no
Emanuel @ [2018-05-07T23:44:35.725Z]: so
Emanuel @ [2018-05-07T23:44:39.190Z]: 1
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-07T23:45:19.495Z]: Let's think about another example, if I go 100 miles in 2 hours, how can I find how many miles I go in 1 hour?
Emanuel @ [2018-05-07T23:46:41.449Z]: 2 devided by 100
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-07T23:46:51.547Z]: Great idea! So how many miles would I go?
Emanuel @ [2018-05-07T23:47:02.791Z]: 50
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-07T23:47:19.303Z]: Awesome! So I can **divide** to find my unit rate, do you see that?
Emanuel @ [2018-05-07T23:47:36.787Z]: yep

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T17:41:35.113Z]: Hi! Let's look over your problem again. Would you like me to type or talk?

Avery @ [2018-05-10T17:42:44.895Z]: HELLO I NEED HELP
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T17:43:00.398Z]: Hello! Let's say the race was 6 miles and broken into 3 sections. How can  we find how many miles **each** section is?
Avery @ [2018-05-10T17:43:15.183Z]: divide
Avery @ [2018-05-10T17:43:19.311Z]: ??
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T17:43:51.734Z]: Ok! How would we use division to help us?
Avery @ [2018-05-10T17:44:09.965Z]: six divided by three??
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T17:44:29.449Z]: Great work! How can you show that as a fraction?
Avery @ [2018-05-10T17:44:52.257Z]: 6/3 or 3/6
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T17:45:07.101Z]: Be careful, order matters in division and with fractions :) If we have 6 ÷ 3, how can we show that as a fraction?
Avery @ [2018-05-10T17:45:39.476Z]: 2/1
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T17:46:05.696Z]: Before you simplify :)
Avery @ [2018-05-10T17:46:22.181Z]: 6/3
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T17:46:46.714Z]: Awesome! Do you see how we can use a fraction to show our division?
Avery @ [2018-05-10T17:47:26.644Z]: no ma'am i do not i dont understand MATH
Avery @ [2018-05-10T17:47:42.864Z]: i think math is a waste of time and air space
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T17:47:59.245Z]: We showed 6 ÷ 3 as 6/3. Do you see that?
Avery @ [2018-05-10T17:48:48.511Z]: well nah duh its right in front of my face like for real you just typed it im pretty sure i see it
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T17:48:59.712Z]: Perfect! Do you think you can use what we talked about and apply it to your problem?
Avery @ [2018-05-10T17:51:33.290Z]: probably not why didnt you just use the same numbers that are in the problem you using 6 and 3 instead 10 and 4 just made it ten times more confusing than it already was js
Avery @ [2018-05-10T17:51:56.016Z]: rn im the definition of confused
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T17:52:16.828Z]: We used an example you can then apply to your problem :)
Avery @ [2018-05-10T17:54:40.071Z]: yes, i see that, but you using different numbers than the ones applied in the word problem made it more confusing to me its like having a word problem that says ' joan has ten dogs and four puppies ' and someone changing the problem to ' joan has four cats and fifteen kittens ' you see how confusing that is MRS. LYNAE?????
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T17:55:30.406Z]: How can we use our example and apply it to your problem?

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T16:31:38.827Z]: That would show 5 ones total, does that match either part of the rectangle here?

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T14:08:14.948Z]: Hello! What is this problem asking you to find here?
Eleanor @ [2018-05-10T14:09:14.136Z]: to use the drop down menu to complete each statment to show why 5 is beetween the 7 square
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T14:10:03.746Z]: Right! We're trying to show a way to **estimate** the square root of 7 if we don't already know it. Does that make sense?
Eleanor @ [2018-05-10T14:10:13.398Z]: yes
Eleanor @ [2018-05-10T14:10:40.523Z]: the square root is 2.6458
Eleanor @ [2018-05-10T14:10:53.522Z]: but it we round it would be 2
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T14:11:28.431Z]: You're right! But if we don't have a calculator handy, we want to show a way we can estimate what square root of 7 would be
Eleanor @ [2018-05-10T14:11:47.099Z]: oh ok
Eleanor @ [2018-05-10T14:12:53.528Z]: it says 4 less than 7 less than 9
Eleanor @ [2018-05-10T14:13:17.511Z]: what does it mean tho when it says in beetween
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T14:14:19.772Z]: Let's think, what do you notice about the numbers 4 and 9?
Eleanor @ [2018-05-10T14:14:47.876Z]: that it has seven in beetween them?
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T14:15:29.339Z]: Are 4 and 9 perfect squares?
Eleanor @ [2018-05-10T14:16:03.933Z]: so when it says 4 greater than 7 greater than 9 so 7 square is beetween blank and blank it wants me to put 4 and 9 in there
Eleanor @ [2018-05-10T14:16:20.037Z]: and yes
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T14:16:51.467Z]: Right! Since 4 and 9 are perfect squares, we can use those numbers to help us estimate the square root of 7. Since we already know what the square root of 4 and 9 are. Does that make sense?
Eleanor @ [2018-05-10T14:17:02.054Z]: yes
Eleanor @ [2018-05-10T14:17:35.750Z]: that means the 7 squrare is beetween 2 and 3
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T14:17:42.529Z]: Right! How can you prove that?
Eleanor @ [2018-05-10T14:17:58.789Z]: becuse those are the highest denonator
Eleanor @ [2018-05-10T14:18:21.582Z]: i just dont get the last qustion
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T14:18:36.429Z]: Ok! What math operation is happening between the 5 and square root of 7?
Eleanor @ [2018-05-10T14:18:57.130Z]: its multiplying?
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T14:19:18.825Z]: You're right! So we want to show how we can estimate that value since we don't know what the square root of 7 exactly equals.
Eleanor @ [2018-05-10T14:19:52.431Z]: oh
Eleanor @ [2018-05-10T14:20:03.281Z]: k
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T14:20:16.638Z]: So if we know the square root of 7 is **between** 2 and 3. How can we **estimate** 5 **times** the square root of 7?
Eleanor @ [2018-05-10T14:20:53.069Z]: its 5.2
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T14:21:20.603Z]: Remember, we're not finding the exact product. We're **showing** how we can estimate what it will be :)

JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:41:27.189Z]: 3
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T17:41:42.226Z]: Yes! So i can say 3 tens and 5 ones, do you see that?
JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:41:43.918Z]: 17 is 10
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T17:41:55.531Z]: So i can say 3 tens and 5 ones, do you see that?
JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:42:27.036Z]: yes
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T17:42:44.870Z]: Awesome! So we have 3 tens and 5 ones and 1 ten and 7 ones. How can we find the total **ones** first?
JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:43:09.888Z]: add them together
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T17:43:28.790Z]: right! So how many total ones do we have?
JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:43:34.054Z]: see i don't know how to do it im never going to get it right
JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:43:45.467Z]: 4

JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:44:41.682Z]: 52
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T17:45:02.175Z]: How can we add 5 + 7?
JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:45:41.649Z]: 7 + 5 = 12
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T17:46:18.090Z]: Awesome! so we have 12 ones. How can we find how many total **tens** we have?
JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:47:06.252Z]: 3 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5
JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:47:35.703Z]: because you bring the 1 from 12 on top of 3 and add
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T17:47:58.126Z]: Remember, we want to keep them separate :) So we have 12 total ones. How many total tens do we have?
JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:48:49.855Z]: 8 ones :)
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T17:49:05.451Z]: That does not answer my question. Please read it again carefully :)

Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T18:23:22.880Z]: What do you mean that estimating means 'nearest thousand?'
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:24:07.609Z]: the problem is 2,057 round by the nerest  thousand?
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T18:24:33.321Z]: Ok so what do you know about **how** to round **any** number to the thousands?
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:25:09.555Z]: 2,000 or 3,00
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:25:16.439Z]: 3,000
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:25:46.085Z]: 3,000?
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:26:10.866Z]: is 3,000 the anser?
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T18:26:26.259Z]: What question of **mine** are you answering?
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:26:43.828Z]: the first one
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T18:27:00.959Z]: Which was what question exactly?
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:27:36.686Z]: Ok so what do you know about how to round any number to the thousands?
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:27:57.918Z]: that one
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T18:28:42.304Z]: Ok but what you said doe s not answer this question. Let me rephrase it
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T18:28:58.926Z]: How would you explain to your classmate how to round any number to the thousands?
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:29:23.241Z]: all i know is that you got to round to the 100s
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:29:35.868Z]: place some times
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T18:30:02.362Z]: What do you mean you 'round to the 100's' when you are rounding to the thousands?
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:31:13.642Z]: becase it is not rounded to the 1,00s if you dont round it to the 100s
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:31:22.350Z]: 1,000
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T18:32:00.962Z]: I don't understand what you mean. Let's take a look at an example together.
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:32:14.365Z]: ok
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T18:32:18.738Z]: If you round 2,345 to the **thousands**, what do you get?
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:32:29.228Z]: 3,000
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:32:32.873Z]: ?
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T18:32:44.735Z]: How did you get that?
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:33:15.274Z]: becase the 100 is 300
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:33:32.921Z]: so that makes it 3,000
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T18:33:43.171Z]: Ok so how does that tell you that 2,345 becomes 3000?
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:34:12.972Z]: the 3 in 2,345 i9s the anser
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:34:31.802Z]: so it makes it 3,000
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T18:34:38.241Z]: Let's look at this more closely. What does it mean to round a number?
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:35:43.079Z]: to show how it is closser to one number or a differnt number
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T18:36:26.535Z]: Great! Since we are rounding to the thousands,  Skip count by 1000 in the chat box until you have 5 numbers
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:37:06.537Z]: 2,000
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:37:10.402Z]: ?
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T18:37:26.695Z]: Why did you start at 2000?
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:37:59.775Z]: becase it is the smallest number you gave me
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T18:38:17.935Z]: No, I said skip count by 1000, not 2000. Please try again.

Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-05-07T23:20:59.059Z]: The area of the parallelogram is 10 x 18
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-05-07T23:21:07.235Z]: But how would you find the area of just one of the triangles? :)
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-05-07T23:22:17.092Z]: I think it would help you to look up 'area' of a triangle in the formulas.
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-05-07T23:23:00.656Z]: Do you know where to find the formulas?
Gianna @ [2018-05-07T23:23:56.040Z]: sorry my copputer was frezzing

Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-09T17:55:00.873Z]: How do we usually measure speed?

Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-08T15:16:47.062Z]: Is it easy to add 100 to any number?
Shayla @ [2018-05-08T15:17:06.516Z]: Also use the interactive Whiteboard please

Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-10T15:59:34.852Z]: But the next number is 8 so how does 8 compare to 4?

Brooklyn @ [2018-05-08T13:56:00.275Z]: because 9 cant take from a smaller number such as 5

Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-07T17:22:29.862Z]: Can you repeat what was said about **unit rate**  in Help 1?
Brooklyn @ [2018-05-07T17:23:37.769Z]: the unit rate is 25
Brooklyn @ [2018-05-07T17:23:46.875Z]: a special ratio
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-07T17:24:02.044Z]: What example are you using?
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-07T17:25:45.599Z]: Are you there?
Brooklyn @ [2018-05-07T17:25:55.212Z]: Example 1
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-07T17:26:38.603Z]: and what about the denominator in a unit rate?
Brooklyn @ [2018-05-07T17:27:15.267Z]: 1
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-07T17:27:57.534Z]: Can you think of another example besides miler per hour?
Brooklyn @ [2018-05-07T17:28:31.697Z]: does it have to be from the example tabs
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-07T17:28:56.966Z]: no
Brooklyn @ [2018-05-07T17:30:23.586Z]: Ok then numerator 16 and the denominator is 8
Brooklyn @ [2018-05-07T17:30:47.759Z]: Does that work?
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-07T17:31:18.403Z]: Is the denominator 1 in your example?
Brooklyn @ [2018-05-07T17:31:42.608Z]: yes
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-07T17:31:54.932Z]: I see 16 and 8

Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-07T14:48:37.679Z]: Can you add these two values without changing how they are written?

Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-07T14:50:53.668Z]: I am understanding you to say that you CAN add fractions without changing the way they are written?

Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-07T14:52:43.923Z]: What do you notice about the denominators in the fractions?
Aliana @ [2018-05-07T14:53:02.074Z]: that they are different
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-07T14:53:11.058Z]: Can you say more about that?
Aliana @ [2018-05-07T14:54:19.494Z]: one denominator is 100 and the other denominator is 10
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-07T14:55:06.575Z]: So what must we do to add them?
Aliana @ [2018-05-07T14:55:37.328Z]: convert
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-07T14:56:35.884Z]: We can only compare things if they are divided into equal sized pieces.

Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-07T14:57:14.345Z]: So now how can we compare **tenths** to **hundredths**?
Aliana @ [2018-05-07T14:57:59.941Z]: by dividing?
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-07T14:58:34.568Z]: what do you think you will divide?
Aliana @ [2018-05-07T14:59:01.402Z]: 100 and 10
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-07T14:59:27.465Z]: and 100 ÷ 10 = ????

Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-07T15:00:39.931Z]: So now 10/100 = 1/10. Now that you have common denominators, you can add 70/100 + 10/100.
