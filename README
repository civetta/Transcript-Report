Ms. Dominique @ [2018-09-12T20:08:09.147Z]: that's right
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-09-12T20:08:28.102Z]: So for the 'change in y'  what is the first number they have listed?

Ms. Dominique @ [2018-09-12T20:08:44.731Z]: right, and where do you think they got that from?

Ms. Dominique @ [2018-09-12T20:09:10.621Z]: Right so what point is the '3' from?

Ms. Dominique @ [2018-09-12T20:10:27.075Z]: right that's the second point, (4,3) right?
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-09-12T20:11:11.932Z]: 3 is the y coordinate of the second point... to find the **change in y** what do you think you'll subtract from 3?

Ms. Dominique @ [2018-09-12T20:12:42.476Z]: Y is the second coordinate of each point
Joshua @ [2018-09-12T20:12:54.214Z]: ok
Joshua @ [2018-09-12T20:12:57.592Z]: so 9

Ms. Dominique @ [2018-09-12T20:13:09.394Z]: So the 'change in y' is 3-9

Ms. Dominique @ [2018-09-12T20:14:06.098Z]: Right good

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-09-17T22:42:48.691Z]: Right! :) so 0.02 is same as 2 out of 100 or 2 / 100, does that make sense?

Melanie @ [2018-09-10T22:35:55.968Z]: its asking for you to solve the problem, but im having trouble with the bottem denomonators because they are not the same.
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-09-10T22:36:10.433Z]: Right! So what has to happen before we can subtract here?
Melanie @ [2018-09-10T22:36:39.441Z]: you have to find the lowest commen denomonator.
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-09-10T22:37:16.491Z]: Okay, let's look at an example on the whiteboard. Ready?

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-09-10T22:38:36.830Z]: Great! So then will we need to do anything right now with 2 1/6?

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-09-10T22:38:59.444Z]: Why?
Melanie @ [2018-09-10T22:39:58.235Z]: because you cant have your denomonator as 6 and you have to do more, but im not sure wgat to do...
Melanie @ [2018-09-10T22:40:16.225Z]: *what
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-09-10T22:40:22.346Z]: But you told me that a common denominator here would be 6, right?

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-09-10T22:41:00.972Z]: Right, so we can leave 2 1/6 alone right now :) Take a look at 1 2/3, how will we change that to have a denominator of 6?

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-09-10T22:42:04.562Z]: Look at 2/3, what will you need to do with the 3 to get to a 6?

Melanie @ [2018-09-10T22:46:53.805Z]: 3 x 2 = 6, so dose that mean your new denomonator is 2??

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-08-23T23:48:28.426Z]: But it was 2 tens and 3 ones, what number is that really?
Karla @ [2018-08-23T23:48:44.569Z]: 23
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-08-23T23:49:09.977Z]: Right, not 5. So then do you agree with his final answer?
Karla @ [2018-08-23T23:49:38.026Z]: yes i agree
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-08-23T23:51:15.335Z]: Look at the whiteboard. In the example, we have 46-12. In the picture we have 4 tens. Can you cross out 1 ten?
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-08-23T23:51:53.033Z]: Cross out 1 ten in the picture of tens and ones
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-08-23T23:52:47.093Z]: Karla, do you see the tens and ones blocks?
Karla @ [2018-08-23T23:53:31.247Z]: oh sorry
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-08-23T23:53:51.036Z]: Right! :)
Karla @ [2018-08-23T23:54:16.191Z]: now
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-08-23T23:54:16.753Z]: and now we have 6 ones... cross out 2 ones
Karla @ [2018-08-23T23:54:25.872Z]: ok
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-08-23T23:55:02.647Z]: So now, what number is left out of the blocks?
Karla @ [2018-08-23T23:55:24.359Z]: 4
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-08-23T23:55:48.612Z]: 4 ones, but how many tens?
Karla @ [2018-08-23T23:56:03.476Z]: 3 tens
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-08-23T23:56:15.012Z]: yes, we have 3 tens and 4 ones... so what number is that?
Karla @ [2018-08-23T23:56:34.736Z]: 34
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-08-23T23:57:00.701Z]: Right! So then in our example, **46 - 12 = 34** Do you see how we used tens and ones to figure that out?
Karla @ [2018-08-23T23:57:20.216Z]: ya

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-09-18T17:30:37.624Z]: small example to help. how can you use math to check that 6 ÷ 3 = 2 ?
MICHAEL @ [2018-09-18T17:30:48.070Z]: x
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-09-18T17:30:55.187Z]: How?
MICHAEL @ [2018-09-18T17:31:16.032Z]: multiply 3x2=6
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-09-18T17:31:23.760Z]: so if 6 ÷ 3 = 2, then 2 × 3 = 6, right?
MICHAEL @ [2018-09-18T17:31:29.226Z]: yup
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-09-18T17:31:37.394Z]: so now, how can you use math to check that 7 ÷ 3 = 2 R1
MICHAEL @ [2018-09-18T17:31:59.558Z]: what  is R1
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-09-18T17:32:05.857Z]: It is a remainder
MICHAEL @ [2018-09-18T17:32:20.307Z]: oh
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-09-18T17:32:47.058Z]: :)
MICHAEL @ [2018-09-18T17:33:49.692Z]: no because 3x2=6 but you have to count by ones to get to 7 because its odd
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-09-18T17:34:00.206Z]: how can you use the 3, 2 and 1 to get back to 7?
MICHAEL @ [2018-09-18T17:34:58.853Z]: (3x2)+2
MICHAEL @ [2018-09-18T17:35:19.258Z]: =7
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-09-18T17:35:28.599Z]: 3 × 2 + 2?

MICHAEL @ [2018-09-18T17:35:47.494Z]: :)
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-09-18T17:36:01.685Z]: Not exactly,  we have 3, 2 and 1 to get to 7. How can we do that?
MICHAEL @ [2018-09-18T17:36:19.903Z]: divide them
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-09-18T17:36:31.855Z]: How did you use 3 and 2 to get 6?
MICHAEL @ [2018-09-18T17:36:41.030Z]: multiply
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-09-18T17:36:57.183Z]: Yes, and then we have an extra 1, so what can we do with it?
MICHAEL @ [2018-09-18T17:37:23.178Z]: add it
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-09-18T17:37:36.426Z]: RIght! if **7** ÷ 3 = 2 R1, then 1 + 2×3 = **7** Make sense?

Ms. Jessica @ [2018-09-06T17:55:51.249Z]: In a **proportional** relationship, the ratio stays the same which means both quantities change at a **constant** rate!

Ms. Jessica @ [2018-09-06T17:58:53.826Z]: Well it will slow right before it comes back down right? So the speed wont stay consistent!

Ms. Jessica @ [2018-09-06T17:59:37.213Z]: Lets look at the car ride. Is the speed consistent the whole 8 min?

Ms. Jessica @ [2018-09-06T18:00:19.295Z]: Why not?
LOWRY @ [2018-09-06T18:01:03.988Z]: because when a redlight appear you are going to have to slow down and sometimes they change the spped limit

Ms. Jessica @ [2018-09-06T18:01:45.355Z]: You are right! But based on what the problem says, it says it is a constant rate! So no stop lights on this road :)

Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-14T17:21:36.793Z]: great strategy! WHen you added 3 potatoes, what did you get?

Victoria @ [2018-09-14T17:23:21.688Z]: How many pumpkins?
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-14T17:23:52.117Z]: It looks like you just dragged the pumpkin down 1 time, so let's try that
Victoria @ [2018-09-14T17:25:08.153Z]: Wait how would you add 3/4 + 2 3/8
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-14T17:25:25.719Z]: That's a great question :)  How do 8ths compare to 4ths?
Victoria @ [2018-09-14T17:25:49.654Z]: A 4 is half of 8
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-14T17:26:14.216Z]: That's right :)  So 1/4 = 2/8.  2/4 = 4/8
Victoria @ [2018-09-14T17:26:42.172Z]: Please explain a little more
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-14T17:27:16.982Z]: Let's use estimation to help us.  3/8 is pretty close to 4/8... what could we say about 4/8 ?
Victoria @ [2018-09-14T17:28:47.125Z]: 4/8 is half of 8/8
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-14T17:29:09.626Z]: That's perfect :)  When we look at the pumpkin then, let's estimate that it weighs **about** 2 1/2 pounds
Victoria @ [2018-09-14T17:29:31.677Z]: ok
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-14T17:29:58.662Z]: If we add 2 1/2 to just a bit less than 1 (3/4) what do we get?
Victoria @ [2018-09-14T17:31:47.422Z]: But 3/4 isn't a half of 4/4
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-14T17:32:13.588Z]: You're right. Let's estimate and say it's close to 4/4 though.  Now we have about 1 pound of potatoes and about 2 1/2 pounds of pumpkin
Victoria @ [2018-09-14T17:33:59.265Z]: Ok so wouldn't we have to add 1 pound and 2 1/2 pounds

Ramael @ [2018-09-05T21:04:19.702Z]: ten
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-05T21:04:26.968Z]: Right :)  when we're rounding to the nearest ten
Ramael @ [2018-09-05T21:04:46.946Z]: 8 is in 5-9 so u round up
Ramael @ [2018-09-05T21:05:03.774Z]: anything on the right turns to 0
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-05T21:05:07.496Z]: That's a great way to think of it :)  I think you have it from here! Keep up the awesome work!
Ramael @ [2018-09-05T21:05:25.760Z]: so 18 rounded to the nearest 10 is 10
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-05T21:05:54.360Z]: Not quite, remember you told me that the 8 ones is in the 5-9 group so we round our 1 ten up to be 2 tens :)
Ramael @ [2018-09-05T21:06:02.068Z]: so 18 rounded to the nearest 10 is 10
Ramael @ [2018-09-05T21:06:15.327Z]: oh

Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-12T19:34:55.118Z]: Okay, let's talk about it! That's a good question :)  Please click the 'glossary' button and see what it says about 'prime'

Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-12T21:12:28.078Z]: Let's say i know I want to end up with 800 candies, and 100 pieces come in a box.  How many boxes would I need to order?

Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-12T21:13:51.800Z]: 1 box holds 100 pieces of candy.  How many would 2 boxes hold?

Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-12T21:15:11.839Z]: 800 boxes with 800 pieces each would look like 800 x 800.  Does that equal 800 ?

Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-12T21:16:29.780Z]: You're right, that's way too much.  Let's keep adding another box until we get to 800 total pieces
Alina @ [2018-09-12T21:16:40.756Z]: ok
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-12T21:17:01.413Z]: How many boxes did we need?

Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-12T21:17:40.240Z]: Perfect, yes if each holds 100 we can skip count by 100 for 8 times to reach 800 piece
Alina @ [2018-09-12T21:17:54.652Z]: right
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-12T21:18:07.777Z]: Let's say we already have 2 boxes at home.  How many more boxes would we need to buy so we have 8 total?
Alina @ [2018-09-12T21:19:08.879Z]: 6
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-12T21:19:33.107Z]: Right on!  If we need to buy 6 more boxes, how many pieces of candy would those 6 boxes hold all together?

Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-05T21:44:34.878Z]: Okay so let's use that idea.  If you copied my amount of cookies and I had 4, how many cookies would we have?
Ava @ [2018-09-05T21:44:48.209Z]: sorry I'm just really happy I did it correct :D
Ava @ [2018-09-05T21:45:13.130Z]: hmm...

Abrianna @ [2018-09-10T18:16:28.786Z]: Idont no
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-10T18:17:03.132Z]: Let's try one.  What would 4 x 2 = ?
Abrianna @ [2018-09-10T18:17:13.719Z]: ok
Abrianna @ [2018-09-10T18:17:32.427Z]: 8
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-10T18:18:00.982Z]: Perfect.  How can we prove that?
Abrianna @ [2018-09-10T18:19:44.331Z]: you can add2 4
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-10T18:20:55.459Z]: THat's a perfect way to think of it.  Yes, we are just doubling it. :) What would happen if we divided 8 by 2 ?
Abrianna @ [2018-09-10T18:22:20.963Z]: There will be 5 groups
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-10T18:22:42.156Z]: Sometimes drawing it out can help us see better.
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-10T18:22:59.662Z]: Please split these into 2 equal groups
Abrianna @ [2018-09-10T18:23:53.902Z]: Im don
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-10T18:24:07.824Z]: Great, I notice that you made 2 groups of 4 :)
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-10T18:24:21.553Z]: So how are division and multiplication related?
Abrianna @ [2018-09-10T18:24:51.365Z]: Idont now
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-10T18:25:21.910Z]: When we were multiplying by 2 what were we doing?
Abrianna @ [2018-09-10T18:26:30.243Z]: idont rilly now
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-10T18:26:52.647Z]: Let's go back to what you told me before.  how did you find 4 x 2 ?
Abrianna @ [2018-09-10T18:27:03.413Z]: 8
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-10T18:27:25.593Z]: Right and you told me we could prove that by taking 4 + 4
Abrianna @ [2018-09-10T18:27:40.088Z]: 8
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-10T18:28:10.405Z]: GOod :) so we see that multiplying by 2 is just combining 2 equal groups.  When we divided, what did we do?
Abrianna @ [2018-09-10T18:28:54.314Z]: ADD!
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-10T18:29:22.163Z]: Let's look at our drawing to see what you did.  It looks like you split them up into 2 equal groups is that right?
Abrianna @ [2018-09-10T18:30:04.819Z]: yes?
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-10T18:31:00.261Z]: Great :)  when we divide, we split it up into equal groups.  This is just the opposite of when we multiplly
Abrianna @ [2018-09-10T18:33:05.027Z]: What dose opposite meen?
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-10T18:33:35.382Z]: Great question!  Let's talk about that.  Hot and cold are **opposites**.  What do opposites do to each other?
Abrianna @ [2018-09-10T18:34:22.096Z]: I DONT NO?
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-10T18:34:51.979Z]: It's okay :) Opposites undo each other :)
Abrianna @ [2018-09-10T18:35:28.272Z]: ok?

Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-04T18:00:20.836Z]: can you show me what 6 ones would look like?

Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-04T18:01:06.477Z]: Yes :)
Jason @ [2018-09-04T18:01:15.650Z]: there
Jason @ [2018-09-04T18:01:18.512Z]: done
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-04T18:01:56.536Z]: Great, can you circle them so they show 6 ones broken into 2 groups of 3?
Jason @ [2018-09-04T18:02:11.716Z]: there
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-04T18:02:32.439Z]: You're on the right track, but be careful, we only want to have a total of 2 groups
Jason @ [2018-09-04T18:02:42.261Z]: oh ok
Jason @ [2018-09-04T18:02:46.455Z]: sorry

Jason @ [2018-09-04T18:03:23.609Z]: ok
Jason @ [2018-09-04T18:04:14.857Z]: oh i messed up :(
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-04T18:04:21.634Z]: we have 6 **ONES** split into 2 groups of 3 **ONES** what would be ten times more than our example of 6 ones?
Jason @ [2018-09-04T18:04:47.615Z]: 15
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-04T18:04:57.100Z]: What math did you use to find that?
Jason @ [2018-09-04T18:05:36.126Z]: i was thinking wrong i messed up sorry :(
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-04T18:06:00.968Z]: It's okay, you're doing fine.  Let's think about it like this... what is 10 x 6 = ?
Jason @ [2018-09-04T18:06:07.438Z]: 60
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-04T18:06:48.404Z]: That's right, ten times as much is 60 ones.  Let's regroup those into tens.  How many tens can we make from 60 ones?
Jason @ [2018-09-04T18:07:20.956Z]: 6
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-04T18:07:35.790Z]: You've got it! so if we split 6 tens into 2 groups, what would be in each group?
Jason @ [2018-09-04T18:08:06.919Z]: 2
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-04T18:08:26.658Z]: Let's check that out.  2 tens + 2 tens = ___ tens
Jason @ [2018-09-04T18:08:44.959Z]: 4 tens
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-04T18:09:14.806Z]: That's right.  We know that we have 6 tens though, so _____ tens + _____ tens = 6 tens?
Jason @ [2018-09-04T18:09:55.211Z]: so 4 tens + 2 tens equals 6 tens
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-04T18:10:36.329Z]: I understand why you think that, but let's look at this another way. Remember that we are wanting to split 6 tens into 2 equal sized groups.  How many tens would be in each of those 2 groups?
Jason @ [2018-09-04T18:10:58.726Z]: 3
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-04T18:11:27.437Z]: You've got it! yes 60 is ten times 6... we can say that 6 **TENS** is ten times more than 6 **ONES**
Jason @ [2018-09-04T18:12:14.453Z]: are we done then
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-04T18:12:31.044Z]: your problem works the same way :) Do you have any more questions before trying the rest on your own?

Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-14T20:04:12.220Z]: I like that idea of using subtraction repeatedly to solve division :) Please tell me more about  that.  Why are we subtracting 42 in our first step?

Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-11T18:13:02.946Z]: RIght, the distance gets smaller.  What if we were just measuring the total distance we had walked all together (and not just how far we were from home) ?
Kyla @ [2018-09-11T18:13:22.524Z]: Im not sure
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-11T18:13:56.442Z]: Let's say it took me 2 miles to get to the top and 2 mile to get back.  How many total miles did we hike?
Kyla @ [2018-09-11T18:14:05.510Z]: 4
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-11T18:14:39.981Z]: Sweet!  Okay, if we measure total distance we went 4 miles.  If we measure how far we are from home we're back to 0 when we get back.  Does it tell us what kind of distance we want to measure?
Kyla @ [2018-09-11T18:15:16.905Z]: Will you please erase everything i did please
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-09-11T18:15:35.080Z]: Did you see my question above?

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-06T23:32:32.255Z]: Can  you prove that maybe in an example? :)
Adriana @ [2018-09-06T23:33:00.502Z]: y= 2x
Adriana @ [2018-09-06T23:34:02.730Z]: they relate by saying that 2 being multiply by a certain number being x can have the result of y
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-06T23:34:16.950Z]: Wow! I am impressed on how you thought about that! :)
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-06T23:35:15.942Z]: So are you saying  the x is always affected by 2 no matter what the x
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-06T23:35:17.089Z]: is
Adriana @ [2018-09-06T23:36:27.108Z]: well but i may think that it also can be the other way like x=2y or even with another lettters
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-06T23:37:37.437Z]: yes exactly so either way, one number is multiplied by 2 which gives you x. now is there something constant in this relationship?
Adriana @ [2018-09-06T23:38:30.704Z]: i may think, not really sure

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-04T21:03:01.891Z]: ok so what do you know about dividing?
Suzlee @ [2018-09-04T21:03:40.000Z]: i know that when you divide a number its split into whatever the divisor is.
Suzlee @ [2018-09-04T21:04:00.201Z]: never mind the divisor
Suzlee @ [2018-09-04T21:04:13.612Z]: i mean dividend
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-04T21:04:55.144Z]: So are you saying  that dividend is divided by a divisor? :)
Suzlee @ [2018-09-04T21:06:12.411Z]: Im saying that i know that when you are dividing you split whatever number you have and then you get your quotient
Suzlee @ [2018-09-04T21:06:35.235Z]: sorry this is my first time talk to a teacher only :)
Suzlee @ [2018-09-04T21:06:39.652Z]: online*
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-04T21:06:40.294Z]: yes, got it! thats ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-04T21:07:18.563Z]: so lets start talking about what Yen is saying
Suzlee @ [2018-09-04T21:08:22.523Z]: Yen is saying that just because you are taking your zero off that you can get your quotient
Suzlee @ [2018-09-04T21:08:27.051Z]: and i disagree.
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-04T21:08:42.205Z]: ok how can you prove that Yen is wrong?
Suzlee @ [2018-09-04T21:09:10.664Z]: i do a different equation.
Suzlee @ [2018-09-04T21:09:41.122Z]: all he has to do is move the decimal
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-04T21:10:00.565Z]: Can you say more about how you got that? ok show me on the whiteboard
Suzlee @ [2018-09-04T21:10:43.211Z]: sorry my handwriting is bad
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-04T21:11:08.308Z]: ok no worries :)
Suzlee @ [2018-09-04T21:12:31.360Z]: the answer is 2.316
Suzlee @ [2018-09-04T21:13:08.889Z]: on the other hand, Yen thinks its 23.16
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-04T21:14:12.885Z]: ok and what is the difference between 23.16 and 23.160?
Suzlee @ [2018-09-04T21:15:13.613Z]: the other number has a zero instead of ntohing there for the first number
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-04T21:15:36.998Z]: so does the zero make a difference?
Suzlee @ [2018-09-04T21:15:49.031Z]: no

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-10T22:17:04.510Z]: yes perimeter measures the outside :) so what are the perimeters of the shapes?

Daranee @ [2018-09-10T21:07:11.798Z]: They want me to add 98 to a number
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-10T21:07:44.523Z]: ok so first you chose Add 100. Then subtract 98. how did you think about that?
Daranee @ [2018-09-10T21:08:53.731Z]: Will it still equal 100?

Angelica @ [2018-09-13T01:27:35.971Z]: There would be a remainder aka decimal but that is not what this lesson is about
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-13T01:28:30.991Z]: well it a decimal is not necessary in this case we just need to represent our math with division

Jesse @ [2018-09-19T00:59:26.184Z]: all have 0
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-19T00:59:59.740Z]: yes so every time we add 4 to 6 it brings us to the next 10
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-19T01:00:23.637Z]: do you see that?

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-14T00:15:33.994Z]: what does comparing mean?
BROOKLYNN @ [2018-09-14T00:16:21.973Z]: its where you get two numbers and you see which one is bigger
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-14T00:16:57.418Z]: ok great! so do we need to compare here?
BROOKLYNN @ [2018-09-14T00:17:35.319Z]: yes we need to see if its equal less than or greater than with the numbers that they show you
BROOKLYNN @ [2018-09-14T00:18:07.048Z]: but what i'm having trouble with is the fractions that we have to compare with fractions
BROOKLYNN @ [2018-09-14T00:18:28.246Z]: i mean we have to compare fractions with decimals
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-14T00:19:13.400Z]: ok and you can also convert the fractions with decimals if it makes it easier. just another strategy
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-14T00:19:41.735Z]: can i show you an example of converting a fraction into a decimal?
BROOKLYNN @ [2018-09-14T00:19:58.200Z]: yes that might help a lot
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-14T00:20:15.089Z]: ok Do you see the whiteboard?
BROOKLYNN @ [2018-09-14T00:20:21.385Z]: yes i do
BROOKLYNN @ [2018-09-14T00:21:03.367Z]: now what are we going to do with the white board?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-14T00:22:37.720Z]: when you take divide a number by multiple of 10 you move the decimal to the left however many 0s. only with tens
BROOKLYNN @ [2018-09-14T00:23:18.572Z]: so how do you know how much zero's to use when you do this?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-14T00:24:00.055Z]: well there are two 0s in 100 so i know to move it over two places
BROOKLYNN @ [2018-09-14T00:24:47.340Z]: so is it okay if i answer my question with the example still up and i can tell you if i get it right?
BROOKLYNN @ [2018-09-14T00:25:07.263Z]: and also the example can help me a lot

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-17T21:12:53.432Z]: so lets extend this a little and think about how multiplication and division relate. when we multiply, it is like repeated adding. does that make sense?
Brandon @ [2018-09-17T21:13:10.976Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-17T21:14:10.880Z]: ok so now how can we think of division? lets use the same numbers in the same family
Brandon @ [2018-09-17T21:14:23.978Z]: ok
Brandon @ [2018-09-17T21:15:02.251Z]: 9
Brandon @ [2018-09-17T21:16:10.407Z]: what no
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-17T21:16:14.728Z]: do you my green equation?
Brandon @ [2018-09-17T21:16:26.473Z]: yes
Brandon @ [2018-09-17T21:17:31.017Z]: 6%3=2
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-17T21:17:34.401Z]: yes so division decides how many equal groups are made. it is like repeated subtraction
Brandon @ [2018-09-17T21:19:00.855Z]: the 6.
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-17T21:19:25.320Z]: does the fact families make sense to u?
Brandon @ [2018-09-17T21:19:35.229Z]: no
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-17T21:19:54.663Z]: what doesnt make sense?
Brandon @ [2018-09-17T21:22:14.051Z]: fact family with 3'2'6' looks like
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-17T21:23:23.925Z]: oh i see well I used the factors of  3 and 2 to make 6 as in 3x2=6 right. are you with me?
Brandon @ [2018-09-17T21:23:50.670Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-17T21:24:31.876Z]: ok so now i related that same multiplication family with division. i used the same numbers to also make a division problem.
Brandon @ [2018-09-17T21:24:57.556Z]: 100x200=
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-17T21:24:59.358Z]: do you see that in green?
Brandon @ [2018-09-17T21:25:11.262Z]: no
Brandon @ [2018-09-17T21:25:29.517Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-17T21:25:31.661Z]: where are you getting the 100 x 200 =?
Brandon @ [2018-09-17T21:26:04.384Z]: my dad
Brandon @ [2018-09-17T21:27:07.978Z]: tlod me
Brandon @ [2018-09-17T21:28:19.492Z]: halle
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-17T21:28:57.642Z]: ok lets stick to the example so you can apply it to the real problem.
Brandon @ [2018-09-17T21:29:14.947Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-17T21:29:14.995Z]: lets just start over
Brandon @ [2018-09-17T21:29:22.298Z]: ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-17T21:30:19.594Z]: lets make a multiplication problem out of those numbers that are true! :)
Brandon @ [2018-09-17T21:30:30.695Z]: ok
Brandon @ [2018-09-17T21:30:47.506Z]: 5x4=
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-17T21:30:54.674Z]: super! equal waht?
Brandon @ [2018-09-17T21:30:59.115Z]: 20
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-17T21:31:21.928Z]: great! what about another multiplication using the same numbers?
Brandon @ [2018-09-17T21:32:04.536Z]: 20x5=
Brandon @ [2018-09-17T21:33:02.622Z]: or 20x4=
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-17T21:33:38.302Z]: no because 20 x 4 = does not equal 5
Brandon @ [2018-09-17T21:33:49.432Z]: oh
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-17T21:34:00.601Z]: remember the same numbers but they have to be true. you can even switch them around
Brandon @ [2018-09-17T21:34:56.927Z]: ok but i have to go
Brandon @ [2018-09-17T21:35:44.057Z]: Ms. johana

Aiyanna @ [2018-08-23T22:07:58.148Z]: I know that proportional describes size or amount and equal ratios
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-08-23T22:08:42.014Z]: how did you think about the first situation?
Aiyanna @ [2018-08-23T22:09:10.510Z]: What do you exactly mean by the question?
Aiyanna @ [2018-08-23T22:10:37.660Z]: It is saying that each time a person purchases a shirt the company gets $4
Aiyanna @ [2018-08-23T22:12:36.913Z]: Your fine. I think the relationship might be, proportional because I'm pretty sure they have something in common
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-08-23T22:13:39.510Z]: ok you are on the right track! please say more
Aiyanna @ [2018-08-23T22:15:03.954Z]: Thank you! I think they both have a number in common to equal something, it's kinda hard to explain but what i'm trying to say is that I think that you could have some multiplication involved
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-08-23T22:16:13.413Z]: sure lets figure it out together. Do you see the whiteboard?

Aiyanna @ [2018-08-23T22:21:58.742Z]: Is this correct?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-08-23T22:23:01.499Z]: well lets think about this reasonably. does it make sense to pay for a 0 tshirts? :)
Aiyanna @ [2018-08-23T22:23:09.299Z]: oh no it doesnt, I assumed it should stay there
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-08-23T22:23:23.441Z]: ok no worries :)

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-08-23T22:28:20.269Z]: so if we buy 1 shirt, then how much will it cost?

Aiyanna @ [2018-08-23T22:29:11.346Z]: May I please be able to draw?

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-08-23T22:30:49.849Z]: but how much would 2 shirts be?
Aiyanna @ [2018-08-23T22:31:02.037Z]: $4
Aiyanna @ [2018-08-23T22:31:10.225Z]: i meant to say 8

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-08-23T22:33:07.470Z]: what is the relationship?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-08-23T22:33:33.413Z]: use an expression if you need to too
Aiyanna @ [2018-08-23T22:33:40.283Z]: Multiplaction, the money keeps getting higher
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-08-23T22:34:21.543Z]: yes so how would you make an expression to represent this?
Aiyanna @ [2018-08-23T22:35:00.066Z]: 1 times 4 = 4
Aiyanna @ [2018-08-23T22:35:11.809Z]: Making the cost $8
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-08-23T22:37:22.539Z]: super! so when we have a direct relationship with a constant, it is called a linear relationship.
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-08-23T22:38:12.518Z]: because it is linear, it is also proportional. does that make sense?
Aiyanna @ [2018-08-23T22:38:23.921Z]: Yes it sure does
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-08-23T22:40:42.733Z]: ok See if you can use what we did to try this on your own.

ISELLA @ [2018-09-18T00:16:54.473Z]: You have to see what numbers the greatest number is divided by?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-18T00:17:18.104Z]: ok can you explain that reasoning with this problem?
ISELLA @ [2018-09-18T00:17:34.368Z]: No.
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-18T00:17:46.010Z]: why not?
ISELLA @ [2018-09-18T00:17:50.448Z]: All the blanks are just confusing.
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-18T00:18:43.112Z]: ok so dont let it confuse you. it is suppose to help you keep track of the numbers as you perform each step

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-18T00:19:01.419Z]: lets start by asking if 7 can go into 4?
ISELLA @ [2018-09-18T00:19:16.994Z]: It can't
ISELLA @ [2018-09-18T00:19:51.465Z]: But 4 can go into 7 right?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-18T00:20:21.482Z]: 7 can go into 45 yes but not just 7 alone. you have to include the number before it
ISELLA @ [2018-09-18T00:20:40.477Z]: Okay
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-18T00:21:58.990Z]: ok so what did you decide?
ISELLA @ [2018-09-18T00:22:51.401Z]: That I have to do 7 x 6 to get 42 because 7 can only go into 45 6 times.
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-18T00:23:27.260Z]: Fantastic thinking!
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-18T00:23:36.140Z]: so what do you put above the 5?

Samantha @ [2018-09-04T23:12:07.602Z]: thats the best way i can explain it
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-04T23:12:30.011Z]: i think thats a good start :) Let's take a look at an example together.
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-04T23:12:38.026Z]: Here is an example of factors: 3 x 2 = 6 so the  numbers 3 and 2 are factors.
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-09-04T23:14:42.614Z]: so now understanding this, what are factors?

Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-05T17:09:16.924Z]: Tell me why you chose to divide by 2/2?'
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-05T17:09:19.199Z]: That is correct
Danielle @ [2018-09-05T17:09:33.111Z]: well its a whole
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-05T17:09:42.343Z]: right, 2/2 = 1 whole
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-05T17:09:51.533Z]: What happens to a number when you divide it by 1 whole?
Danielle @ [2018-09-05T17:10:08.381Z]: its stays the same
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-05T17:10:29.691Z]: yes, so the value will be something 'equivalent'
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-05T17:10:42.531Z]: in this problem you are looking for the fraction that is equivalent to 10/14
Danielle @ [2018-09-05T17:10:48.870Z]: yesssssss
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-05T17:11:01.447Z]: Do you see that the equivalent fraction is given to you with a denominator of 7?
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-05T17:11:06.718Z]: 10/14 = ?/7
Danielle @ [2018-09-05T17:11:57.211Z]: im not sure please teach me.
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-05T17:12:21.695Z]: ok, please look at what is given.. do you see 7 in the denominator of the equivalent fraction?
Danielle @ [2018-09-05T17:12:33.902Z]: yes
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-05T17:12:40.319Z]: awesome
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-05T17:12:54.427Z]: Now think about why you chose... 2/2, and not 3/3, or 4/4..
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-05T17:13:08.051Z]: What can you divide 14 by to get 7?
Danielle @ [2018-09-05T17:13:16.741Z]: 2
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-05T17:13:33.154Z]: exactly, that is the reason you need to use 2/2 in this problem
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-05T17:13:41.551Z]: So for the numerator...
Danielle @ [2018-09-05T17:13:42.975Z]: and i did this because you get 14 with 7 and 2
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-05T17:13:51.606Z]: 10  ÷ 2 = ?
Danielle @ [2018-09-05T17:13:55.554Z]: 5

Emmalee @ [2018-09-04T17:55:52.581Z]: its says that i need to drag down 5 crates

Emmalee @ [2018-09-04T17:56:17.000Z]: yes
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-04T17:56:21.456Z]: Do you see that you only used 2?
Emmalee @ [2018-09-04T17:57:44.480Z]: yes but like dont get that there are 15 oranges and you have to put down 5 of them like i knbow there are 15 oranges on the self but dont u have to make a total of 15 oranges
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-04T17:57:59.013Z]: yes a total of 15
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-04T17:58:05.798Z]: and you have to use 5 boxes
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-04T17:58:12.362Z]: 5 boxes of ___ make 15 total?
Emmalee @ [2018-09-04T17:59:05.182Z]: so i have to use the lowest number of oranges like 3
Emmalee @ [2018-09-04T17:59:21.022Z]: so use 3 , 5 times and u get 15
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-04T17:59:27.206Z]: exactly
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-04T17:59:36.328Z]: So 'each' b- 3ox has the same number
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-04T17:59:44.871Z]: sorry, each box has the same number ---3
Emmalee @ [2018-09-04T18:00:30.338Z]: but why cant you just get ten and a 5 that makes 15 like why do they make it harder where u have to put boxes instead of fewer
Emmalee @ [2018-09-04T18:00:38.955Z]: yes
Emmalee @ [2018-09-04T18:00:49.335Z]: do u have to use different numbers
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-04T18:00:50.417Z]: because of the instructions for this problem
Emmalee @ [2018-09-04T18:00:55.929Z]: or the same numbers
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-04T18:00:56.590Z]: you are correct that 10 and 5 also make 15
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-04T18:01:17.236Z]: but the instructions for 'this' problem ask you to use 5 boxes and have the same in each
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-04T18:01:52.041Z]: This problem is about separating into 'equal' groups.
Emmalee @ [2018-09-04T18:01:58.014Z]: ok so on most of these problems u have to uses the same numbers as many times as they ask u
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-04T18:02:19.560Z]: If the problem is about grouping, then yes.
Emmalee @ [2018-09-04T18:02:27.741Z]: ok

Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-14T17:42:18.093Z]: exactly
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-14T17:42:49.427Z]: How many total beads will she need?
Michael @ [2018-09-14T17:43:05.230Z]: 60
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-14T17:43:25.038Z]: yes, so what if she used an equal number of both..
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-14T17:43:30.834Z]: how many of each would that be?
Michael @ [2018-09-14T17:44:08.513Z]: what does that mean
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-14T17:44:28.372Z]: If there are 60 total, and she used the same amount of each..
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-14T17:44:35.123Z]: how many blue and orange would that be?
Michael @ [2018-09-14T17:45:48.468Z]: 24

Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-14T17:49:24.355Z]: ok, Do you think you have it from here?
Michael @ [2018-09-14T17:49:47.394Z]: NO
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-14T17:50:06.716Z]: ok, lets think about if you had equal amounts of both
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-14T17:50:19.999Z]: ___ and ____ = 60
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-14T17:50:36.012Z]: What number can you use if they are both the same?
Michael @ [2018-09-14T17:51:04.371Z]: 21
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-14T17:51:12.443Z]: Not quite, 21 + 21 does not make 60
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-14T17:51:23.049Z]: What value can you use twice to make 60?
Michael @ [2018-09-14T17:51:32.210Z]: 30
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-14T17:52:24.440Z]: yes, so if you had 'equal' amounts of both.. .it would be 30 blue and 30 orange..
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-14T17:52:33.706Z]: but you know from the ratio, that its 3 to 2
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-09-14T17:52:38.679Z]: more blue than orange

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-09-12T16:50:33.980Z]: Great thinking! Now if I wanted to make 9 batches instead, how can I find how many eggs to use?

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-09-12T16:59:55.647Z]: Do you see on the board we have 3 batches that uses 21 eggs and 7 eggs in each batch, like we talked about so far?
Nevaeh @ [2018-09-12T17:00:11.197Z]: yup
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-09-12T17:00:30.612Z]: Awesome! How many more batches do I need to put on the board to make 9 batches?

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-09-12T17:03:09.566Z]: Awesome work! How did you come to that conclusion?
Nevaeh @ [2018-09-12T17:03:29.052Z]: i added all the 7 together
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-09-12T17:04:10.482Z]: That's a great strategy! What is another strategy we can use instead of repeatedly adding 7?
Nevaeh @ [2018-09-12T17:04:25.101Z]: idk
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-09-12T17:04:34.474Z]: Let's think, what math operation represents repeated addition?
Nevaeh @ [2018-09-12T17:05:29.160Z]: 7 times 9
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-09-12T17:06:39.374Z]: Yes! We can use multiplication. I agree you can use what we know about 1 batch. How can we use multiplication to help us staring with 3 batches?

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-09-19T15:16:59.304Z]: Great start! I like how you put 1/2 on the number line :) So if we're using a number **less** than 1/2, can I start about at that red dot?
Marrisah @ [2018-09-19T15:17:15.409Z]: yes
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-09-19T15:18:38.707Z]: Right! So if I count on 2/5 from that red dot, about where would it land?

Delia @ [2018-09-19T16:24:16.442Z]: nope its a decimal
Delia @ [2018-09-19T16:24:53.783Z]: and 11 and 12 is too they are all decimals
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-09-19T16:25:23.545Z]: Exactly, so that is telling you they are not perfect squares. Can you find the closest number to 11 that is less than 11, that is a perfect square?
Delia @ [2018-09-19T16:25:39.518Z]: let me find out
Delia @ [2018-09-19T16:25:48.993Z]: /9 is
Delia @ [2018-09-19T16:25:58.378Z]: 9 is a perfect square
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-09-19T16:26:06.155Z]: Perfect! What about bigger than 11 that is a perfect square?
Delia @ [2018-09-19T16:26:55.742Z]: 16 is bigeer so its between 9 and 16?
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-09-19T16:27:14.413Z]: Fantastic Delia! So now let's actually take the square roots to estimate.
Delia @ [2018-09-19T16:27:25.522Z]: k
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-09-19T16:27:44.192Z]: So what whole numbers does the square root of 11 have to be in between?
Delia @ [2018-09-19T16:27:59.865Z]: 9 and 16
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-09-19T16:28:23.453Z]: That's what 11 is in between. What whole numbers now would the **square root** of 11 be in between?
Delia @ [2018-09-19T16:28:34.596Z]: um
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-09-19T16:28:39.886Z]: Use the board to help you :)
Delia @ [2018-09-19T16:28:51.646Z]: i cnt write on it

Delia @ [2018-09-19T16:29:32.651Z]: idk wat to do :/
Delia @ [2018-09-19T16:29:46.786Z]: never learned this yet
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-09-19T16:29:54.066Z]: We found the perfect squares around the number 11. Now if we actually take the square root of each, what do we have?
Delia @ [2018-09-19T16:30:24.654Z]: 3 and 4?
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-09-19T16:31:36.940Z]: Perfect! Since 11 is not a perfect square, I can **estimate** that the decimal will be in between 3 and 4 by using the perfect squares around it. Do you see how we did that?
Delia @ [2018-09-19T16:32:15.526Z]: yes i kinda under stand it more now :3
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-09-19T16:32:22.014Z]: Perfect! Do you think you can use what we talked about and apply it to your problem?
Delia @ [2018-09-19T16:32:29.458Z]: yea i think so

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-09-19T16:15:25.940Z]: Hello! Sometimes it helps to round the decimals first to the closest whole number to help find where to put the decimal point!
Samantha @ [2018-09-19T16:16:32.786Z]: So what I did was I counted how many paces are after the decimal
Samantha @ [2018-09-19T16:16:39.742Z]: spaces
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-09-19T16:16:54.136Z]: Can you say more about what you mean by that?
Samantha @ [2018-09-19T16:18:53.108Z]: Yeah so on the 7 and 8 there are 2 places at the end so I counted that and then I counted the numbers 1 and 8 and there were 2 places so the total was 4 places.
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-09-19T16:19:40.702Z]: Great strategy! How does that help you find where the decimal place will go in our answer?
Samantha @ [2018-09-19T16:20:38.461Z]: That helps me by counting 4 places to the left of the answer.
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-09-19T16:21:04.251Z]: You know your stuff! How may I help your understanding here?
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-09-19T16:23:09.961Z]: Are you there?

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-09-19T16:23:44.604Z]: That is showing how you can estimate the product to help you figure out where the decimal point should be instead of counting place values like you did :)

Ryan @ [2018-09-19T14:03:28.997Z]: Sophia poster is 0.75 while Rafael's is 0.35 and it wants me to subtract
Ryan @ [2018-09-19T14:03:37.147Z]: right
Ryan @ [2018-09-19T14:04:11.290Z]: because of the key word difference

Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-11T14:09:24.974Z]: Ok so let's go back to my question....did you know you can multiply 2/3 by 2/2 to get 4/6 which also shows equivalence?
Callista @ [2018-09-11T14:10:57.729Z]: 2x3=6 so 6 is the denominator and you multiply 2x2=4 so 4 is the numerator
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-11T14:11:14.125Z]: Correct! Keep that in mind as you work through this problem. Please come back if you need more help. Have a nice day!

Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-04T14:07:00.724Z]: How many solutions will 3x - x + 2 = 2x + 2 have?
SIRRAH @ [2018-09-04T14:08:00.535Z]: I belive it has one solution
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-04T14:08:11.136Z]: Ok, why do you say that?
SIRRAH @ [2018-09-04T14:08:41.811Z]: Because when it is simplified the equation is 2x+2 = 2x+2
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-04T14:09:03.580Z]: Ok so how do you know that means you have one solution?
SIRRAH @ [2018-09-04T14:09:19.280Z]: It equals one x
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-04T14:09:40.499Z]: How do you know x = 1?
SIRRAH @ [2018-09-04T14:10:08.176Z]: I worked it out on my whiteboard and that's what I got.
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-04T14:10:33.482Z]: Please show me how 2x + 2 = 2x + 2 becomes x = 1
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-04T14:11:52.815Z]: That means that x = x, not x = 1. Does that make sense?
SIRRAH @ [2018-09-04T14:12:33.800Z]: Oh... Yes it makes sense now. I was thinking the x was a 1.
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-04T14:12:59.275Z]: Ok so if x = x, how many solutions does that mean 3x - x + 2 = 2x + 2 has then?
SIRRAH @ [2018-09-04T14:13:08.827Z]: None?
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-04T14:13:24.549Z]: Why do you say that?
SIRRAH @ [2018-09-04T14:13:49.668Z]: Because you cannot figure out what x is equal to. Therefore it has no solution
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-04T14:14:23.295Z]: Interesting thinking. What did help 1 tell you about equations that have no solutions?
SIRRAH @ [2018-09-04T14:15:20.885Z]: It just said x + 2 = x
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-04T14:15:47.661Z]: It said more than that. Why did it say that x + 2 = x has no solutions?
SIRRAH @ [2018-09-04T14:16:05.882Z]: Because x=0
SIRRAH @ [2018-09-04T14:16:32.445Z]: Oh 2 = 0
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-04T14:16:44.655Z]: Ok is 2 = 0 a true statement?
SIRRAH @ [2018-09-04T14:17:04.844Z]: I'm not sure.
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-04T14:17:13.273Z]: Does 2 equal 0?
SIRRAH @ [2018-09-04T14:17:19.167Z]: No
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-04T14:17:48.237Z]: Ok since 2 does not equal 0, that is why x + 2 = x has no solutions. Does that make sense?
SIRRAH @ [2018-09-04T14:18:01.984Z]: Yes.
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-04T14:18:18.671Z]: Ok so let's go back to what you have on the whiteboard. Does x = x?
SIRRAH @ [2018-09-04T14:18:36.502Z]: Yes
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-04T14:18:53.139Z]: Ok so how many solutions does 3x - x + 2 = 2x + 2 have then?
SIRRAH @ [2018-09-04T14:19:01.385Z]: One?\
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-04T14:19:18.567Z]: If that's true, what is the value of x then?
SIRRAH @ [2018-09-04T14:19:39.374Z]: One?
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-04T14:20:13.911Z]: But I don't see that you solved to get x = 1, so that doesn't mean that x has a value of 1. Does that make sense?
SIRRAH @ [2018-09-04T14:20:44.371Z]: Yes. Does that mean x = 0?
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-04T14:21:14.070Z]: Only if you solve and you get x = 0, then x has a value of 0.
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-04T14:21:33.669Z]: let's try something...if you put 0 in for x into 3x - x + 2 = 2x + 2, what do you get?
SIRRAH @ [2018-09-04T14:22:06.825Z]: 2=2
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-04T14:22:21.621Z]: Ok, if you put 1 in for x into 3x - x + 2 = 2x + 2, what do you get?
SIRRAH @ [2018-09-04T14:23:00.243Z]: 4=4
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-04T14:23:26.244Z]: Ok are 2 =2 and 4 = 4 both true statements?
SIRRAH @ [2018-09-04T14:23:34.818Z]: Yes
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-04T14:23:58.971Z]: OK, Let;s try one more. if you put -3 in for x into 3x - x + 2 = 2x + 2, what do you get?
SIRRAH @ [2018-09-04T14:25:30.462Z]: I got -10 = -4      I don't think that's correct though..
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-04T14:25:52.845Z]: Show me what you did on the whiteboard
SIRRAH @ [2018-09-04T14:26:51.478Z]: Oh i gotta go. sorry
SIRRAH @ [2018-09-04T14:26:56.124Z]: class is ending
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-04T14:27:03.749Z]: No problem... Please come back if you need more help. Have a nice day!

Manny @ [2018-09-18T15:05:58.088Z]: In the answers  the denominators are different
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-18T15:06:09.553Z]: Let's take a look at an example together.
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-18T15:07:07.596Z]: What fraction represents the red parts?
Manny @ [2018-09-18T15:07:17.885Z]: 2/4
Manny @ [2018-09-18T15:07:50.285Z]: Hello

Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-18T15:08:49.312Z]: What fraction are green?
Manny @ [2018-09-18T15:08:56.567Z]: Can’t understand what you wrote on tope of 2/4
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-18T15:09:34.519Z]: Yes, isn't that what you said is the fraction for the red?
Manny @ [2018-09-18T15:10:00.464Z]: Ok 👌
Manny @ [2018-09-18T15:10:32.289Z]: The green is also 2/4
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-18T15:11:33.215Z]: Ok so if we put the 2 boxes together, what fraction is shaded any color?
Manny @ [2018-09-18T15:11:49.636Z]: 4 /4
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-18T15:12:03.739Z]: How did you get that?
Manny @ [2018-09-18T15:13:25.138Z]: 2+2 count lady
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-18T15:13:41.520Z]: Ok but what exactly are you counting?
Manny @ [2018-09-18T15:14:00.567Z]: 2+2=4
Manny @ [2018-09-18T15:14:17.696Z]: Add
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-18T15:14:23.748Z]: Ok but is that the shaded parts, the unshaded parts or all the parts in the whole rectangle?
Manny @ [2018-09-18T15:15:01.191Z]: 4 green
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-18T15:16:02.574Z]: I don't see 4 green shaded so what do you mean that 2 + 2 = 4 green?
Manny @ [2018-09-18T15:16:16.544Z]: It’s 4/4 because you add the denominators from both fractions 2/4 + 2/4
Manny @ [2018-09-18T15:16:35.975Z]: Meant numerator
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-18T15:17:07.654Z]: ok but What does the denominator of **any** fraction tell you?
Manny @ [2018-09-18T15:17:46.994Z]: It stay the same because you cannot add the denominators if they are the same
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-18T15:17:59.512Z]: What question of mine are you answering?
Manny @ [2018-09-18T15:18:24.649Z]: Denominators of any fraction
Ms. Caren @ [2018-09-18T15:19:23.341Z]: What denominator would you use for the yellow rectangle?

Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-09-11T23:10:51.375Z]: when you round to the hundredths place, the thousandths are 0

Jasmyn @ [2018-09-11T23:11:07.756Z]: oh
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-09-11T23:11:22.260Z]: so 3.829 would round to 3.83

GARRETT @ [2018-09-11T20:52:06.514Z]: What size bowl will fit with 1 one half + 3 and 2 thirds
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-09-11T20:52:09.581Z]: Great!
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-09-11T20:52:13.348Z]: How would you approach this?

Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-09-11T20:53:08.908Z]: Okay!
GARRETT @ [2018-09-11T20:53:20.201Z]: Then we can narrow it down to the most likely
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-09-11T20:53:35.995Z]: How can you tell if a 4 1/2 quart bowl will hold the mixture?
GARRETT @ [2018-09-11T20:54:51.632Z]: If 1 and one half and 3 and two thirds add up to below 4 and one half
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-09-11T20:55:04.604Z]: Can you prove that to me?
GARRETT @ [2018-09-11T20:57:01.256Z]: One third is less than a half so 1 and one half and 3 and 2 thirds would be slightly smaller than 4 and one half
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-09-11T20:57:33.727Z]: I see what you mean, however, remember you also have 1 whole and 3 wholes as well
GARRETT @ [2018-09-11T20:58:10.547Z]: So the smallest possible bowl to hold the mixture would be 4 and 1 half.
GARRETT @ [2018-09-11T20:58:24.369Z]: Right?
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-09-11T20:58:36.286Z]: let's try in the whiteboard, okay?

Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-09-11T20:59:30.813Z]: how would you show 3 2/3?
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-09-11T21:00:00.817Z]: Brilliant!
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-09-11T21:00:07.899Z]: if you combine them, will you have less than 4 1/2?
GARRETT @ [2018-09-11T21:00:11.470Z]: Yes
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-09-11T21:00:45.118Z]: What do you think happens when we combine that 1/2 and 2/3?
GARRETT @ [2018-09-11T21:01:33.025Z]: Oh, there is more than another 1 whole, so then the answer is 5 and 1 half.

Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-09-19T22:42:17.958Z]: so one way to find the total is by subtracting the odometer readings. The other way is by adding the distances.
MORGAN @ [2018-09-19T22:42:28.947Z]: Ok.
MORGAN @ [2018-09-19T22:43:06.775Z]: So it could be 2.3 + 293.8 + 308.2?

Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-09-20T01:17:09.919Z]: Are you there?
CONSTANCIA RUT @ [2018-09-20T01:17:21.338Z]: yes.
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-09-20T01:17:39.968Z]: great!
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-09-20T01:17:48.034Z]: What strategy would you use to divide 400 ÷  40?
CONSTANCIA RUT @ [2018-09-20T01:18:38.953Z]: remove the 0 and then divide
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-09-20T01:18:51.225Z]: does that *always* work?
CONSTANCIA RUT @ [2018-09-20T01:19:40.836Z]: whenever 2 #'s have 0's at the end.
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-09-20T01:19:50.765Z]: 400 ÷  40 =
CONSTANCIA RUT @ [2018-09-20T01:20:09.160Z]: 10
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-09-20T01:20:41.383Z]: Excellent! That works in this case, but be careful to not use that rule, because there are cases where removing a 0 doesn't work.
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-09-20T01:21:09.062Z]: For example, 25.70 ÷  10 = 2.57, not 25.7

Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-09-04T20:28:46.552Z]: What would you multiply and add to check **7 ÷  3 = 2 remainder 1**?

Emma @ [2018-09-04T20:29:06.249Z]: No multiply

Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-09-04T20:31:39.706Z]: So 3x2 gets you close to 7 but not exact. What would you do with the remainder of 1 after that?
Emma @ [2018-09-04T20:32:11.943Z]: You would subtract 1 from 7 and you get 6 which is the answer 3 x 2
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-09-04T20:32:41.172Z]: But how can you get back to 7?
Emma @ [2018-09-04T20:33:02.205Z]: Um add 1 to 6
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-09-04T20:33:06.907Z]: There you go!
Emma @ [2018-09-04T20:33:10.054Z]: :)
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-09-04T20:33:21.111Z]: So to check 7 ÷  3 = 2 R 1, you would do **2 x 3 + 1**
Emma @ [2018-09-04T20:33:34.016Z]: Yes ma'm
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-09-04T20:33:52.319Z]: So then how would you check **789 ÷  8 = 98 R5**?
Emma @ [2018-09-04T20:34:16.568Z]: Ummm Do 8 x 98 + 5+?
Emma @ [2018-09-04T20:34:21.898Z]: =?

Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-09-17T22:16:04.643Z]: That is because the smaller number fits inside of the larger more times

Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-09-04T21:24:59.301Z]: excellent! So if 3 friends need 3.6 yards of string each, what would you do?

Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-09-04T21:25:56.550Z]: fantastic! They need 3.6 x 3 yards. You need to decide if the 10.5 yards that Nima bought will be enough :)

Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-11T20:37:18.930Z]: Okay! I'm here to help you Emma!
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-11T20:37:24.316Z]: what do you notice about the position of the 2 points?
Emma @ [2018-09-11T20:37:24.781Z]: Thanks

Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-11T20:38:07.397Z]: What do you notice about the green and pink shaded parts?
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-11T20:38:14.525Z]: Is one longer or shorter than the other?
Emma @ [2018-09-11T20:38:27.712Z]: That it is equivelent to 4/10
Emma @ [2018-09-11T20:38:54.959Z]: 2/5 is equivalent to 4/10
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-11T20:39:10.636Z]: So how can we go from 2/5 to 4/10?
Emma @ [2018-09-11T20:39:41.042Z]: Like how they are equivalent?
Emma @ [2018-09-11T20:39:49.195Z]: Or something else
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-11T20:39:49.242Z]: Yes :)
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-11T20:40:09.764Z]: How could you prove that 2/5 is the same as 4/10?
Emma @ [2018-09-11T20:40:12.360Z]: Ok so 2 is equal to 4 and 5 is equal to 10
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-11T20:40:26.800Z]: 2=4 or do we need to multiply by something?
Emma @ [2018-09-11T20:40:35.253Z]: 5+5 is 10 and 2+2 is 4
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-11T20:41:04.888Z]: Yes, we could also say that 5 is *ha;f* of ten and 2 is *half* of 4
Emma @ [2018-09-11T20:41:12.460Z]: yes
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-11T20:41:26.756Z]: so we can multiply 2/5 by 2/2 to get ot 4/10 :)
Emma @ [2018-09-11T20:41:37.202Z]: yes
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-11T20:41:55.328Z]: Did you know that 2/2 is the same as one whole?
Emma @ [2018-09-11T20:42:10.868Z]: because 2 is equal to 2
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-11T20:42:39.733Z]: Yes! So when we multiply a fraction by the same thing on both the top and bottom, we are multiplying by 1 which doesn't change the value!
Emma @ [2018-09-11T20:42:47.518Z]: Yes ma'm
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-11T20:42:57.914Z]: Do you have any other questions for me?

Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-18T21:37:00.185Z]: let's use an easier example. what does 6 ÷ 2 = ?
Kathleen @ [2018-09-18T21:37:07.941Z]: 3
Kathleen @ [2018-09-18T21:39:19.211Z]: ms. Anna

Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-18T21:39:35.219Z]: Sorry for the wait :)
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-18T21:39:40.618Z]: let's see if there is another way to get 3 without division. what if we subtract by 2's... how many times do you have to minus by 2 until there is nothing left from 6?
Kathleen @ [2018-09-18T21:39:53.817Z]: 2
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-18T21:40:32.463Z]: Let's try... 6 -2  -2 = 2... what would we need to do to get to 0?
Kathleen @ [2018-09-18T21:41:17.730Z]: i dont know
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-18T21:41:32.404Z]: so 6 - 2 - 2 - 2 = 0, right?
Kathleen @ [2018-09-18T21:41:58.266Z]: right hold on
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-18T21:42:28.155Z]: do you see that 6/2 = 3 R0 is the same as subtracting 6 by 2 ....3 times to get 0
Kathleen @ [2018-09-18T21:43:16.408Z]: ya
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-18T21:43:54.644Z]: notice that 6 -2-2-2 = 0 is same as 6 -2(3) = 0 ....meaning to subtract by 2 three times ... SO division is repeated subtracting
Kathleen @ [2018-09-18T21:44:05.119Z]: i get it
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-18T21:44:28.596Z]: great. look at your problem. what are they subtracting by repeatedly?

Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-07T18:19:19.413Z]: How many cups of punch does our original recipe call for?
Gioalys @ [2018-09-07T18:20:15.638Z]: 3 cups of punch and 2 cups of cranberry juice
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-07T18:20:42.753Z]: Great! So is that a total of 5 cups or is the cranberry juice part of that 3 cups?

Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-07T18:21:57.463Z]: Okay, what are the ingredients in the punch?

Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-07T18:23:31.271Z]: So if we have 2 cups of cranberry, how many cups are pineapple if we have 3 cups of punch?
Gioalys @ [2018-09-07T18:24:04.861Z]: umm.. 3?
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-07T18:24:36.351Z]: Not quite.. let's look at a picture
Gioalys @ [2018-09-07T18:24:45.797Z]: ok
Gioalys @ [2018-09-07T18:25:23.833Z]: ok
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-07T18:25:31.525Z]: So our 2 cups of cranberry will add to our one cup of pineapple to make 3 cups of punch
Gioalys @ [2018-09-07T18:25:45.970Z]: ohhhh ok
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-07T18:26:30.521Z]: So if we double the size of the recipe and make 6 cups of punch... how many cups of cranberry should I use?
Gioalys @ [2018-09-07T18:27:01.407Z]: 3?
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-07T18:27:29.029Z]: Why do you say 3?
Gioalys @ [2018-09-07T18:30:06.866Z]: because you use 1 cup of pineapple juice for every 2 cups of cranberry juice you use
Gioalys @ [2018-09-07T18:30:22.854Z]: am i right
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-07T18:30:36.685Z]: Very good! But how does that make 3 cups of cranberry juice for 6 cups of punch?
Gioalys @ [2018-09-07T18:31:16.144Z]: what i dont understand the question  asked me
Gioalys @ [2018-09-07T18:31:54.452Z]: you asked me*
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-07T18:32:17.845Z]: You do use 1 cup of pineapple juice for every 2 cups of cranberry juice you use... but that wouldn't make sense saying 3 cups of cranberry juice in 6 cups of punch
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-07T18:32:42.876Z]: Because then we would have equal amounts of pineapple and cranberry...does that work with our ratio?
Gioalys @ [2018-09-07T18:32:55.423Z]: no?
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-07T18:33:43.613Z]: No it doesn't... we have to keep our ratio the same... so we need to multiply both things by the same thing..what did we multiply 3 by to get to 6?
Gioalys @ [2018-09-07T18:34:25.131Z]: I'm just confused :(
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-07T18:34:56.103Z]: That's okay, it can be a bit confusing to think about... Let's break it down

Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-07T18:36:03.700Z]: If I increase to 6 cups of punch, that would be like multiplying by 2, make sense?
Gioalys @ [2018-09-07T18:36:21.205Z]: kinda
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-07T18:36:37.097Z]: SO I'm basically doubling the recipe

Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-07T18:37:00.681Z]: So when I double to recipe, I also have to double the ingrediants

Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-04T19:59:23.324Z]: Of course! It looks like we need to find factor pairs. What is a factor?
Soheily @ [2018-09-04T19:59:57.089Z]: yes i do
Soheily @ [2018-09-04T20:00:06.029Z]: i really neeed help
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-04T20:00:35.672Z]: A factor are the numbers that we multiply to get to a certain number. For example we are given a factor pair already. 3 and 10
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-04T20:01:20.684Z]: So if we take 3 and 10 and multiply them together we get 3 x 10 = 30 so they are what we call factor pairs of 30, make sense so far?
Soheily @ [2018-09-04T20:01:46.609Z]: i got the answer thank u very much take care have a great day good bye

Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-18T17:14:47.316Z]: So we will divide by 3... 12 ÷ 3 = 4!
Louis @ [2018-09-18T17:14:49.621Z]: Yes or no
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-18T17:14:57.925Z]: How can I get back to 12 from 4?
Louis @ [2018-09-18T17:15:50.429Z]: Divide 12 and 4
Louis @ [2018-09-18T17:16:17.428Z]: Yes
Louis @ [2018-09-18T17:16:37.903Z]: Or no
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-18T17:16:41.883Z]: Not quite, we nned to start with 4 to get back to 12... what should we do?

Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-18T17:18:03.938Z]: let's try... 4 - 3 =1
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-18T17:18:10.005Z]: Did that bring us back to 12?
Louis @ [2018-09-18T17:18:20.785Z]: No so add
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-18T17:18:44.509Z]: Let's try.... Add 3 is an option... 3 + 4 = 7. Did that bring us back to 12?
Louis @ [2018-09-18T17:19:15.247Z]: No but it was close
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-18T17:19:31.842Z]: Yes, let's try another option to see if we can get closer!

Malinda @ [2018-08-24T14:06:01.842Z]: we will have 24 stickers
Ms. Anna @ [2018-08-24T14:06:13.599Z]: What math did you use to get that?
Malinda @ [2018-08-24T14:07:53.906Z]: i use adding 12 + 12
Ms. Anna @ [2018-08-24T14:08:29.838Z]: Very good :) If we were to use multiplication to solve this problem, what numbers do you think we would multiply?
Malinda @ [2018-08-24T14:08:54.815Z]: 12x12
Ms. Anna @ [2018-08-24T14:09:50.586Z]: Let's think, multiplication is like adding, but puts things into groups. If I did 3+3+3+3 it would be the same as 3x4 since I have 4 groups of 3
Malinda @ [2018-08-24T14:10:38.964Z]: yes
Ms. Anna @ [2018-08-24T14:10:39.239Z]: So it won't be 12x12 but what *would* it be?
Malinda @ [2018-08-24T14:10:48.022Z]: 12x4
Ms. Anna @ [2018-08-24T14:11:14.304Z]: How did you get that answer?
Malinda @ [2018-08-24T14:13:07.823Z]: i use the 12 stickers x4 friends
Ms. Anna @ [2018-08-24T14:14:31.228Z]: Very good thinking Malinda!

Ms. Anna @ [2018-08-23T14:46:30.675Z]: suppose instead of 10/14, we had 3/9. can you think of a number that goes into BOTH 3 **and** 9?
JAYDEN @ [2018-08-23T14:46:48.492Z]: 3?
Ms. Anna @ [2018-08-23T14:47:29.539Z]: That's exactly right!
Ms. Anna @ [2018-08-23T14:47:46.149Z]: So what number could go into *both* 10 and 14?
JAYDEN @ [2018-08-23T14:47:57.800Z]: 2
Ms. Anna @ [2018-08-23T14:48:35.258Z]: That's a great idea!

Ms. Anna @ [2018-08-23T14:51:03.258Z]: We are reducing this fraction so it wants to know if anything will divide into both the top and bottom
Ms. Anna @ [2018-08-23T14:52:08.449Z]: Let's take a look visually using the 3/9 example
JAYDEN @ [2018-08-23T14:52:36.180Z]: ok
Ms. Anna @ [2018-08-23T14:52:47.827Z]: So we said that 3 went into both sides

Eylin @ [2018-09-19T20:40:07.274Z]: yes
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-19T20:40:33.650Z]: So how would we get an equivalent fraction for 1/3 with a denominator of 6?

Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-19T21:48:56.738Z]: Close! when you are comparing two things, **proportional** means they both have the same rate or amount of change

Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-19T21:52:28.698Z]: So each row is still the same ratio to it's partner, because both rows get multiplied by3!
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-19T21:52:44.437Z]: So in our table... what did we multiply .75 by to get to 1.5?
Matthew @ [2018-09-19T21:53:21.893Z]: 5
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-19T21:53:46.005Z]: Let's try! What is 5 x 0.75?
Matthew @ [2018-09-19T21:54:36.037Z]: 3.75 so it has to be multiplied with an lower number than 5
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-19T21:55:59.434Z]: RIght, what number should we try next?
Matthew @ [2018-09-19T21:56:08.107Z]: the answer would be 2
Matthew @ [2018-09-19T21:57:27.923Z]: because if you multiply 2 and 0.75 you get 1.5
Ms. Anna @ [2018-09-19T21:57:56.728Z]: Great thinking! SO we would need to multiply 6 by 2 as well to keep it proporional!

Makenzie @ [2018-09-17T18:39:28.541Z]: Is it units?
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-09-17T18:39:49.698Z]: Please share what the  **first**  sentence says.
Makenzie @ [2018-09-17T18:40:54.405Z]: Leon is using an area model to multiply 38 x 14
Makenzie @ [2018-09-17T18:41:06.754Z]: oh area model
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-09-17T18:41:25.738Z]: How does he break 38 and 14 into smaller parts?
Makenzie @ [2018-09-17T18:41:52.098Z]: Using place value
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-09-17T18:42:30.880Z]: Can you say more about that?
Makenzie @ [2018-09-17T18:43:21.041Z]: he breaks it up using place value to make it easier
Makenzie @ [2018-09-17T18:43:25.377Z]: .
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-09-17T18:43:38.334Z]: How does he break 38 into tens and ones?

Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-09-17T18:45:11.624Z]: Do you see these values in Leon's model?
Makenzie @ [2018-09-17T18:45:45.818Z]: Yes ma'am
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-09-17T18:46:17.350Z]: How does he break the numbers apart/
Makenzie @ [2018-09-17T18:47:24.951Z]: By dividing the digits
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-09-17T18:47:38.804Z]: How many tens are in 38?
Makenzie @ [2018-09-17T18:47:55.809Z]: 3 tens ma'am
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-09-17T18:48:05.097Z]: and 3 tens = ???
Makenzie @ [2018-09-17T18:48:35.960Z]: 3 tens = 30
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-09-17T18:48:55.274Z]: and how many ones are in 38?
Makenzie @ [2018-09-17T18:49:02.654Z]: 38
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-09-17T18:49:11.600Z]: What is in the ones place in 38?
Makenzie @ [2018-09-17T18:49:18.021Z]: 8
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-09-17T18:49:28.637Z]: So then 38 = 30 + 8, make sense?
Makenzie @ [2018-09-17T18:49:45.304Z]: yes ma'am
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-09-17T18:50:19.961Z]: That is what we are talking about here. Leon breaks both numbers into then and ones, so 38 = 30 + 8.
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-09-17T18:50:31.221Z]: and how can you break 14 into tens and ones?
Makenzie @ [2018-09-17T18:51:01.698Z]: 10 + 4 = 14
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-09-17T18:51:46.119Z]: right! and after he breaks the numbers apart, he used the area model to multiply.
Makenzie @ [2018-09-17T18:51:56.394Z]: Sorry i have to log off

Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-09-18T14:00:59.663Z]: Math operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Shamarie @ [2018-09-18T14:01:18.820Z]: Addition
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-09-18T14:01:31.042Z]: What can you tell me about addition and subtraction?

Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-09-18T14:02:34.263Z]: Do you remember that addition and subtraction are inverse operations? In other words, they undo each other. So if 8 - 5 = 3, then 3 + 5 = 8. Does that sound familiar?

Jakirra @ [2018-08-23T23:32:13.645Z]: They are alike in some ways
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-08-23T23:32:24.506Z]: OK. Can you say more about that?
Jakirra @ [2018-08-23T23:35:22.076Z]: You can check your work by dividing when your multiplying, they can have the same answer for example 2 x 5 =10 or 5% 2=10
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-08-23T23:35:44.694Z]: good thinking!!!! What math fact are you given to work with here?
Jakirra @ [2018-08-23T23:36:15.289Z]: 3 x 25=75
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-08-23T23:36:50.478Z]: and what is the division problem we can make?
Jakirra @ [2018-08-23T23:37:25.805Z]: 75 divide 25 =3
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-08-23T23:37:53.599Z]: Let's take a closer look at this.
Jakirra @ [2018-08-23T23:38:04.243Z]: ok
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-08-23T23:38:22.686Z]: Where does the decimal point go in a whole number?

Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-08-23T23:39:27.788Z]: Did you know that all whole numbers have a decimal?
Jakirra @ [2018-08-23T23:39:40.130Z]: they do??
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-08-23T23:39:57.521Z]: Sure do!!!
Jakirra @ [2018-08-23T23:40:28.869Z]: wow
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-08-23T23:40:58.364Z]: So if we move the decimal point ONE place to the left in 25, what do you think will happen to the answer?
Jakirra @ [2018-08-23T23:41:28.249Z]: I'm a little confused
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-08-23T23:41:55.546Z]: No worries!
Jakirra @ [2018-08-23T23:42:04.746Z]: ok
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-08-23T23:42:17.637Z]: Did you know that when you divide a number by 10, the decimal point moves ONE place to the LEFT?
Jakirra @ [2018-08-23T23:43:05.000Z]: yes because its like mr.dl
Jakirra @ [2018-08-23T23:43:12.906Z]: MR.DL
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-08-23T23:43:27.871Z]: so where would the decimal point go in the 75 if we divide by 10?
Jakirra @ [2018-08-23T23:43:52.560Z]: BETWEEN 7 AND 5
Jakirra @ [2018-08-23T23:44:33.874Z]: I think
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-08-23T23:44:43.578Z]: right!!!
Jakirra @ [2018-08-23T23:45:08.179Z]: MR.DL
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-08-23T23:46:16.220Z]: Did you know that when you **divide** a number by **10**, the answer is **one-tenth** the value of the original number?
Jakirra @ [2018-08-23T23:46:32.765Z]: No
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-08-23T23:46:52.055Z]: So 1/10 of 25 = 2.5 and 1/10 of 75 is 7.5. Make sense?

Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-09-07T13:07:41.659Z]: What 3 categories are you asked to match to?

Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-09-07T13:07:55.512Z]: No worries!  Did you see my question?
Jayel @ [2018-09-07T13:08:03.990Z]: 6/1- 6/6-- or neither

Jayel @ [2018-09-07T13:08:35.067Z]: and yes
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-09-07T13:08:55.072Z]: How can we compare numbers that are not written in the same form?
Jayel @ [2018-09-07T13:09:13.778Z]: decimals?
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-09-07T13:09:17.384Z]: Let's try a similar example.
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-09-07T13:09:43.442Z]: Are these written in the same form?
Jayel @ [2018-09-07T13:09:47.158Z]: no
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-09-07T13:10:15.351Z]: So how do you think we can compare them to see if they are equivalent.
Jayel @ [2018-09-07T13:10:27.208Z]: um
Jayel @ [2018-09-07T13:10:48.400Z]: we could use a chart
Jayel @ [2018-09-07T13:10:56.087Z]: for tenths
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-09-07T13:11:39.619Z]: Can you explain your thinking please? Can you show me on the whiteboard?
Jayel @ [2018-09-07T13:11:58.273Z]: how do i do that exactly
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-09-07T13:12:06.302Z]: use the pen tool.
Jayel @ [2018-09-07T13:12:10.888Z]: okay
Jayel @ [2018-09-07T13:13:09.973Z]: kind of hard to read
Jayel @ [2018-09-07T13:13:32.246Z]: it is meant to show ten
Jayel @ [2018-09-07T13:13:51.484Z]: and then each of them colored in
Jayel @ [2018-09-07T13:13:57.447Z]: should be 5
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-09-07T13:14:22.657Z]: Good thinking! So If we made the same chart with 100 parts, how many of them would we need to shade to = 5/10?
Jayel @ [2018-09-07T13:14:30.558Z]: 50
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-09-07T13:15:00.102Z]: Perfect!!! So now can we say that 50/100 = 5/10?
Jayel @ [2018-09-07T13:15:11.043Z]: yes
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-09-07T13:15:21.923Z]: But could we say that 5/100 = 5/10?
Jayel @ [2018-09-07T13:15:32.480Z]: No
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-09-07T13:15:37.524Z]: Can you say why?
