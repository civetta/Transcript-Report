Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:33:47.410Z]: Did you hear my voice?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:34:38.905Z]: what are factors?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:35:53.239Z]: yes, they are numbers like a first factor is the first number in a probem
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:36:18.381Z]: ok so what is the job of a factor?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:37:04.237Z]: do not understand
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:37:16.058Z]: Please look up words you are unfamiliar with in the glossary you have been provided. :)
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:37:22.777Z]: like factors :)
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:37:30.906Z]: i did
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:37:45.820Z]: ok so what did your definition say?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:39:32.347Z]: a whole number muitply by one or more whole number
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:39:50.589Z]: Fantastic thinking! yay!
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:40:06.780Z]: thx
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:40:26.658Z]: now can factors be prime, composite or both?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:44:31.290Z]: no because they are each different suff
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:44:57.143Z]: hi
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:45:01.335Z]: hello
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:45:03.903Z]: Can you say more about how you got that?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:45:05.108Z]: hi'
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:45:10.664Z]: ok
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:47:09.950Z]: they are because they each have different meaning
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:47:29.979Z]: ok so what is a prime number?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:48:52.648Z]: a whole with 2 factor
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:49:11.359Z]: not quite but you can look up what prime means
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:50:49.511Z]: i did
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:51:02.606Z]: ok so what is a prime number?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:53:07.633Z]: a whole number with two factors and 1 is not a prime number because it is only one number
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:53:20.967Z]: super!
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:53:49.599Z]: so lets compare numbers 1, 2 , and 4
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:53:59.856Z]: how many factors make up the 1?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:55:24.709Z]: 0
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:56:31.191Z]: well remember what factors are: 2 numbers multiplied to get a product
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:56:49.332Z]: 1
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:57:33.972Z]: ok so really 1 has a factor 1  and itself right?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:57:42.333Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:58:14.570Z]: ok so what kind of number is 1
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:58:55.733Z]: not a prime numbers
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:59:21.095Z]: ok can you explain not?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:59:58.115Z]: i mean it is not a prime number
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:00:31.317Z]: Fantastic thinking! 1 is unique so it is not considered a prime number. what other numbers are prime?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:00:58.410Z]: 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:01:43.484Z]: Not quite, but good effort! Let's work together to figure this out.
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:01:59.079Z]: lets establish some clarifications
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:02:21.894Z]: wait 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:04:30.345Z]: ok so how are you getting these numbers? what is your reasoning?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:06:21.333Z]: because it says 1 is not a prime number
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:06:49.697Z]: ok but we need to know why :)
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:07:25.899Z]: so what are the factors of 2?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:08:20.628Z]: 1
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:09:04.481Z]: 2 x 1 = 2
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:09:11.331Z]: are there any other factors of 2?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:09:25.925Z]: 2
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:09:54.017Z]: ok what other factor goes with 2 ?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:10:14.156Z]: 4
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:11:05.037Z]: so you are saying that there is 4 x ? = 2
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:11:26.841Z]: n0
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:11:44.432Z]: ok so the only true factors of 2 are 2x1
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:11:51.994Z]: does that make sense?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:12:05.549Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:12:21.016Z]: so lets categorize it on the whiteboard
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:12:33.614Z]: what about 3
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:12:43.703Z]: what factors when multiplied = 3?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:13:37.995Z]: do not have one
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:14:09.865Z]: what do you mean by that?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:14:49.666Z]: i do not have a answer
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:15:09.167Z]: ok so you still dont know what factors are do you?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:15:14.989Z]: you can be honest
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:16:09.751Z]: i do not what they are
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:16:39.042Z]: ok lets use an example on the white board
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:16:47.324Z]: ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:16:58.579Z]: what number do you see?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:16:58.591Z]: 8
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:17:04.182Z]: great!
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:17:10.766Z]: 4 2
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:17:14.296Z]: 8 is the product or the answer to a multiplication problem
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:17:34.012Z]: the 4 and 2 are the factors
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:17:44.912Z]: o
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:18:13.057Z]: ok so
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:18:27.877Z]: now we can also classify numbers into two groups
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:18:35.803Z]: do they have it in eyery problem
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:18:55.105Z]: yes every NUMBER can be either composite or prime
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:18:59.471Z]: does that make sense
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:19:11.999Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:20:08.526Z]: ok so now are there any other factos for 8?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:20:31.469Z]: 4 2 2 4
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:21:01.054Z]: yes but essentially they are the same numbers right?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:21:05.298Z]: how about 8x1
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:21:24.655Z]: yea
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:22:13.414Z]: ok so because eight has 2 pairs of factors it is COMPOSITE
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:22:22.182Z]: does that make sense?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:23:14.140Z]: yes thank you have a great night
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:23:17.328Z]: bye

RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:23:14.588Z]: type or talk witch ever works for you
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:23:26.965Z]: lets type
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:23:31.462Z]: ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:23:35.359Z]: how can i help?
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:24:35.111Z]: i dont know exactly how to get the answer for the last problem 4/6=blank then i have to fill in the blank
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:24:49.459Z]: oh ok
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:24:55.302Z]: and it has to be in fraction form
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:25:26.633Z]: so how did you think about the others you got correcT&gt;
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:26:35.298Z]: it gave me one of the numbers so  i figured out how they got it and the way i thought they got the other number i used to get the number i needded
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:27:05.164Z]: Way to pay attention to those clues!
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:27:23.556Z]: so now in the last one, what can help you regarding the denominator?
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:28:32.465Z]: it didnt give me any numbers thats why  need  help cause i dont know what to multiply by
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:29:00.946Z]: ok so lets make some observations based on the other equivalent fractions
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:29:16.759Z]: for example
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:29:22.213Z]: Do you see the whiteboard?
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:29:49.905Z]: yess
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:30:03.566Z]: how are 3 and 6 similar?
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:30:21.208Z]: you multiply by 2??
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:31:00.187Z]: yes! perfect! so 6 is part of the 3 multiple family
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:31:22.825Z]: yep
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:32:02.078Z]: one observation is that in order to have equivalent fractions, the numerators have to share a common multiple
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:32:06.545Z]: does that make sense?
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:32:38.037Z]: kinda could you explain a little more please
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:32:41.859Z]: sure
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:33:06.004Z]: thank you
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:33:26.579Z]: the green numbers are all multiples
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:33:38.993Z]: do you see that?
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:34:10.876Z]: yes and the red numbers are what you multiplying by right
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:34:45.684Z]: well the red number is the number family
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:35:01.053Z]: it is what you are skip counting by
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:35:07.114Z]: oh
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:35:18.166Z]: 3,6,9,12,
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:35:31.948Z]: then what comes next if we are skip counting by 3?
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:35:55.493Z]: 15,18,21,24,27
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:36:09.202Z]: Fantastic thinking! those multiples could go on and on!
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:36:29.509Z]: now when we compare fractions the numerators have to share a common multiple
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:36:39.546Z]: which we decided was 6
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:37:19.016Z]: would we multiply by 6 then
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:37:22.628Z]: are you with me?
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:37:33.597Z]: yepp
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:37:41.616Z]: well how did you think about multiplying by six?
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:38:55.361Z]: cause  both 3 and 6 have a multiple of 6
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:39:34.007Z]: ok i see! but actually we would find the factor that would could use to relate the two numbers
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:40:02.401Z]: what do u mean by relate
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:40:16.588Z]: what numbers 3 x ? = 6
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:40:24.152Z]: 2
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:40:37.572Z]: super that is called the common factor
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:40:48.723Z]: oh ok.
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:41:13.303Z]: so what we do to the NUMERATOR with the common factor we have to also do to the DENOMINATOR
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:41:52.218Z]: And thats a way we can get equivalent fractions
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:41:53.753Z]: find common factors ?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:42:10.207Z]: well common multiples
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:42:27.297Z]: then fill in the factors to make the equation true
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:42:49.479Z]: so lets try the bottom one and walk me thru it
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:43:26.538Z]: whats your first thought?
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:44:36.686Z]: i honestly  cant remember much after like 5 minutes thats why i need extra help in math cause i have difficulties understanding it
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:44:49.218Z]: Please give it a try! It is okay to make mistakes.
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:45:19.158Z]: would we multily by 2
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:45:26.749Z]: ***multiply
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:45:59.705Z]: ok so essentially we would just be doubling the fraction right when we multiply by 2 right?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:46:07.985Z]: we can do that :)
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:46:21.329Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:46:40.283Z]: so we have to do the same to the top
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:46:46.683Z]: 8/12
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:46:52.881Z]: wu/
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:46:55.354Z]: is that the answer

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T22:25:35.004Z]: so 3 halves make what amount?
ISABELA @ [2018-05-08T22:26:29.603Z]: It equals 2whole
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T22:27:42.308Z]: not quite, please try again. Think about the question one more time :)
ISABELA @ [2018-05-08T22:28:13.735Z]: I don’t know??
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T22:28:31.220Z]: well we know we know 2 halves make 1 whole
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T22:28:46.134Z]: then if we add 1 more half, what does it make together?
ISABELA @ [2018-05-08T22:28:57.954Z]: 4
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T22:29:53.953Z]: do you see my blue sentence?

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T22:31:35.877Z]: it would be 1 and one half
ISABELA @ [2018-05-08T22:32:06.356Z]: Yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T22:32:21.119Z]: we can also find that using multiplication
ISABELA @ [2018-05-08T22:33:10.961Z]: Well I have to do istatoin thanks for your time

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:25:59.333Z]: Hi! Let's look over your problem again. Would you like me to type or talk?
IBRAHIM @ [2018-05-09T01:26:10.264Z]: type
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:26:34.892Z]: what is Adian needing to know?
IBRAHIM @ [2018-05-09T01:27:18.554Z]: How far from the library is the park
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:28:14.504Z]: yes so how can we start thinking about this problem?
IBRAHIM @ [2018-05-09T01:28:49.704Z]: I don't know
IBRAHIM @ [2018-05-09T01:29:49.791Z]: Divide?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:30:08.155Z]: ok why do you say divide?
IBRAHIM @ [2018-05-09T01:31:26.917Z]: because you subtract  293.8 and 308.2 then divide 308.2 and 2?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:31:55.826Z]: not quite actually there is no dividing involved but there is finding the difference
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:32:08.811Z]: so we have two facts of information
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:32:14.388Z]: reading 1 and reading 2
IBRAHIM @ [2018-05-09T01:32:39.413Z]: ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:33:41.279Z]: so you said we would subtract right?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:33:47.948Z]: how did you reason that?
IBRAHIM @ [2018-05-09T01:34:02.337Z]: you add 293.8 and 2.3 then subtract that from 308.2
IBRAHIM @ [2018-05-09T01:34:36.825Z]: because 308.2 is the total
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:36:58.731Z]: reading 1 + reading 2 = 308.2
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:37:05.886Z]: is that what you are saying?
IBRAHIM @ [2018-05-09T01:37:34.231Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:38:02.552Z]: ok so lets plug it in
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:39:09.218Z]: does that make sense?
IBRAHIM @ [2018-05-09T01:39:28.747Z]: what is 12.10
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:40:16.723Z]: thats the distance from the library to the park
IBRAHIM @ [2018-05-09T01:40:44.815Z]: I get it

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:19:39.718Z]: Did you hear my voice?
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:19:44.645Z]: No
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:19:51.888Z]: HOW ABOUT now?
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:20:09.490Z]: Well no but i guess you could type
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:20:31.215Z]: ok so what does perimeter mean?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:20:43.460Z]: the space around or the space inside a shape?
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:20:56.254Z]: Its the outside of a figure
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:21:14.891Z]: becouse area is the inside of a figure
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:21:21.896Z]: or shape
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:21:24.312Z]: Wow! I am impressed on how you thought about that! :)
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:21:41.504Z]: thanks
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:21:49.688Z]: what do you think the perimeter of the photo is?
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:22:24.799Z]: i dont get you?
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:22:34.089Z]: like what do you mean?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:22:51.917Z]: what is the perimeterof the photo in the problem?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:22:57.590Z]: it tells u in the problem
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:23:04.916Z]: oh
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:24:34.650Z]: Well i know that right now its 6 but if you add 2 on each of the other sides the total is 10?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:24:51.847Z]: Fantastic thinking!
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:24:56.745Z]: :)
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:25:04.636Z]: you figured it out!!
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:25:12.385Z]: so the answer is 2
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:25:22.999Z]: ?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:25:40.044Z]: yes and how would you use it in a perimeter equation?
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:26:14.525Z]: 6+2=10 perimeter?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:26:27.158Z]: 6+2=8
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:26:38.316Z]: yeah thats what i meant sorry
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:26:42.854Z]: rememeber the formula for perimeter?
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:26:49.163Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:26:54.984Z]: what is it?
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:27:25.760Z]: it would be 3+2=5 and then again 3+2=5 so 5+5=10?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:28:01.572Z]: yes exactly
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:28:12.373Z]: ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:28:14.893Z]: 2 x length + 2 x width = perimeter
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:28:22.985Z]: Yeah
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:28:39.356Z]: so 2 ( 3) + 2 ( 2) = 10
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:29:05.033Z]: Yes so the answer is 2 Thankyou Ms.Johana! :)
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:29:15.026Z]: Please come back if you need more help. Have a nice day!

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:15:47.950Z]: nice!!!
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:16:01.687Z]: ok so what are they doing in each answer choice?
Bushra @ [2018-05-09T01:17:12.574Z]: they are showing fraction statements
Bushra @ [2018-05-09T01:17:48.551Z]: hello?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:18:05.308Z]: yes but do you notice what they r doing to the fractions?
Bushra @ [2018-05-09T01:19:13.195Z]: they are multiplying fractions?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:19:39.612Z]: yes in three of the solutions but they moreso REDUCING FRACTIONS
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:19:51.521Z]: do you know what reducing or simplifying means?
Bushra @ [2018-05-09T01:20:33.449Z]: i dont wat simplifying means
Bushra @ [2018-05-09T01:21:19.178Z]: oops i meant i dont KNOW wat simplifying means
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:21:35.488Z]: ok it means to make a fraction less complicated but still equal in value
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:21:37.974Z]: Let's take a look at an example together.
Bushra @ [2018-05-09T01:21:54.133Z]: ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:23:00.126Z]: i can simplify this fraction on the white board
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:23:28.300Z]: meaning I can find a less complicated fraction that is equal to it if i find a common reducing factor

Caroline @ [2018-05-10T22:46:20.107Z]: Well, how can you make 4 batches of bread with 5 cups of flour, if 5 doesn.t go into 4?
Caroline @ [2018-05-10T22:46:46.580Z]: *doesn't
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-10T22:46:46.803Z]: i like how you are thinking!

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-10T22:47:18.879Z]: so do you think that each of the 4 batches will use exactly 1 cup of flour
Caroline @ [2018-05-10T22:47:32.025Z]: no
Caroline @ [2018-05-10T22:47:52.083Z]: yes actually

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-10T22:51:58.357Z]: ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-10T22:52:31.485Z]: What would happen if we shared each cup of flour with each batch?
Caroline @ [2018-05-10T22:52:55.473Z]: um...
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-10T22:53:11.896Z]: lets visualize it
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-10T22:53:17.734Z]: Do you see the whiteboard?
Caroline @ [2018-05-10T22:53:27.183Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-10T22:54:16.647Z]: so lets say this is a batch
Caroline @ [2018-05-10T22:54:23.255Z]: ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-10T22:54:24.275Z]: how many batches are there?

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-10T22:55:01.235Z]: each separate square is a batch
Caroline @ [2018-05-10T22:55:09.136Z]: ook
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-10T22:55:59.783Z]: how can i represent the 5 cups of flour needed?
Caroline @ [2018-05-10T22:58:08.694Z]: i dont really know
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-10T22:58:50.955Z]: ok let me represent
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-10T23:02:13.945Z]: wait I missing a batch
Caroline @ [2018-05-10T23:02:45.221Z]: so you would need 1 batch?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-10T23:02:53.724Z]: well let me reset this
Caroline @ [2018-05-10T23:03:10.548Z]: ok

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-10T23:04:02.231Z]: and now the red ones are the 5 cups
Caroline @ [2018-05-10T23:04:10.562Z]: ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-10T23:04:41.886Z]: ![Image](https://content.thinkthroughmath.com/live_teaching_images%2F5bcc275a-e21b-4005-8995-9663f478f79f%2F3.JPG)
Caroline @ [2018-05-10T23:06:39.588Z]: so 2 cups of flour are together in the same batch?
Caroline @ [2018-05-10T23:06:52.104Z]: 1 cup i mean
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-10T23:07:35.638Z]: no, but each batch shares at least a cup right?

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:53:49.891Z]: Hi! Let's look over your problem again. Your device does not support chat audio. We need to type. Ready?
Daniel @ [2018-05-09T01:53:59.781Z]: Yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:54:18.338Z]: great! so what do you think scale means in this problem?
Daniel @ [2018-05-09T01:54:34.338Z]: The ratio.
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:54:47.065Z]: super! so what is the ratio?
Daniel @ [2018-05-09T01:54:56.210Z]: l=w
Daniel @ [2018-05-09T01:55:11.362Z]: l*w=a
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:55:11.523Z]: Can you say more about how you got that?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:55:23.680Z]: what does l mean?
Daniel @ [2018-05-09T01:55:38.045Z]: The length times the width equals the area
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:55:55.351Z]: ok thats the area but not the ratio
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:55:59.142Z]: ok Let's take a look at an example together.
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:57:11.045Z]: so lets say the smaller square is 1/2 scale drawing of the orginial and bigger figure
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:57:39.986Z]: that means the smaller square is 1/2 smaller than the bigger one
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:57:56.406Z]: or the bigger square is twice as big as the small one
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:58:01.241Z]: does that make sense?
Daniel @ [2018-05-09T01:58:05.311Z]: Yes
Daniel @ [2018-05-09T01:58:48.367Z]: That means the smaller square is half the size as the bigger
Daniel @ [2018-05-09T01:59:03.196Z]: whih means the smaller square is 2
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:59:03.917Z]: ok so how can we figure out the length of the smaller square! and yes thats right
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:59:07.322Z]: Fantastic thinking!
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:59:42.422Z]: how did you get 2 by the way?
Daniel @ [2018-05-09T02:00:49.718Z]: Because 4 divided by 1/2 is 2 because i already knew half of four is two
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T02:01:02.746Z]: nice! so you divided :)
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T02:01:11.679Z]: so what would be the width?
Daniel @ [2018-05-09T02:01:12.513Z]: In my head yes.
Daniel @ [2018-05-09T02:01:33.394Z]: the width would b 3
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T02:01:34.150Z]: the width of the smaller one
Daniel @ [2018-05-09T02:01:50.459Z]: be*
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T02:02:02.470Z]: yes
Daniel @ [2018-05-09T02:02:26.771Z]: Great
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T02:02:38.826Z]: I think you have it from here! Keep up the awesome work!

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:00:03.136Z]: Hi! Let's look over your problem again. Would you like me to type or talk?
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:00:14.287Z]: type
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:00:38.109Z]: ok so what is the equation of  a circle?
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:01:14.847Z]: (x-h)^2+(y-k)^2
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:01:22.045Z]: i think
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:01:51.935Z]: how did you find that equation?
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:02:15.147Z]: because my geo teacher taught me
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:02:17.833Z]: memory
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:02:53.938Z]: ok so what equation is described in the problem?
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:03:55.928Z]: x^2+y^2-4x+2y=4
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:04:55.369Z]: ok great! so the question asks which of the given choices represents the SAME x^2+y^2-4x+2y=4?
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:05:32.112Z]: I'm lost
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:06:07.852Z]: ok Let's take a look at an example together.
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:06:19.145Z]: ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:06:21.516Z]: Do you see the whiteboard?
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:06:43.944Z]: yes ma'am
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:07:00.730Z]: can you write an equivalent equation?
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:07:20.346Z]: x^2+2^2
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:07:27.549Z]: ..?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:07:37.146Z]: well not quite
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:07:50.718Z]: since I am squaring the expression then it would be represented as such
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:08:28.928Z]: ok
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:08:46.474Z]: like foil
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:08:53.639Z]: yes
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:09:21.333Z]: ok so what now?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:11:04.559Z]: ok so now we have to relate the same concept to what the problem is asking
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:11:45.893Z]: so if the question is asking that equation represents a circle, then one of the given choices is equal to it
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:11:50.734Z]: does that make sense?
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:11:59.503Z]: yes

Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T01:56:13.002Z]: ye
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T01:56:16.453Z]: *yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:56:28.958Z]: ok so what do they want to do with the figure?
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T01:56:50.480Z]: they want the correct dimensions
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:57:14.184Z]: yes and  Have you thougt of another way to solve it?
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T01:57:25.052Z]: no
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T01:57:44.971Z]: please help me
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:58:08.401Z]: ok so how can i help?
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T01:59:17.781Z]: with finding the correct dimensions
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:59:40.986Z]: ok so what do we know about the dimensions?
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:00:18.197Z]: that there is 2 types of dimensions 3d and 2d
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:00:38.550Z]: yes and the dimensions can also mean measurements
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:01:00.253Z]: does that make sense?
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:01:12.034Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:01:49.936Z]: ok so we know the measurements in the given diagram right?
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:02:07.428Z]: yea
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:02:08.835Z]: i think it would easier to see in an example so Let's take a look at an example together.
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:03:37.964Z]: so the red square is 1/2 the scale of the white square
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:03:42.428Z]: are you with me?
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:03:46.971Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:04:19.899Z]: and how can i prove that with the measurements given?
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:04:47.393Z]: by multiplying?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:05:13.640Z]: ok can you say more about that?
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:05:32.718Z]: and by dividing?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:06:39.262Z]: thats a start!
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:07:00.129Z]: so just by looking at the lengths, how do they compare?
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:07:53.960Z]: 4 is a multiple of 2
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:08:03.067Z]: 10 is a multiple of 5
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:08:47.858Z]: yes and we also that 5 is half of 10 right
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:08:55.905Z]: and 2 is half of 4
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:09:07.121Z]: so the scale proportion is 1/2
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:09:18.123Z]: we can prove this mathematically too!
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:09:27.819Z]: yes
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:09:56.924Z]: so that means that the red shape is half of the white one
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:10:19.198Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:10:31.111Z]: and 1/2 is the scale proportion
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:11:03.012Z]: so when the problem shares the word 'scale' it means what proportion of the orginial it is
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:11:11.771Z]: does that make sense?
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:11:24.140Z]: kinda
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:11:40.888Z]: ok so lets switch the numbers a little
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:11:46.052Z]: 1/2 was kinda easy
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:11:53.877Z]: ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:12:19.372Z]: lets say the red square is 1/3 of the white square
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:12:39.803Z]: so i need to know what is 1/3 of the dimensions then correct?
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:13:00.831Z]: yes

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:19:06.116Z]: Hi! Let's look over your problem again. Would you like me to type or talk?
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:20:07.170Z]: hi this imagine math teacher I was just chatting with her and she just ended the chat for no reason
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:20:17.412Z]: ok sorry to hear that
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:20:23.395Z]: ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:20:30.024Z]: so what do you understand?
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:20:46.242Z]: understand about what
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:20:55.320Z]: the problem ??
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:21:14.788Z]: how far did you get with the other teacher?
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:21:47.720Z]: we didn't even go far, she barely helped me
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:22:05.185Z]: Her name is Mrs.B
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:22:25.013Z]: Hello
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:22:29.996Z]: ok sorry to hear that again
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:22:34.004Z]: What do you already know that might be useful here?
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:23:37.874Z]: I don't know anything,i just wanted help from the other teacher, but can you help
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:24:15.127Z]: i bet u do!  so  are we estimating in this problem?
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:24:27.021Z]: yes I think
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:25:12.830Z]: and how do you know that?
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:25:44.603Z]: because they have one same number
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:25:58.690Z]: ok what are they?
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:26:03.466Z]: 3 • 25 = 75
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:26:08.588Z]: 75 ÷ 25 = 3
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:26:18.834Z]: they both have 25
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:26:53.634Z]: super! so there is a connection between 25, 3 and 75
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:27:07.981Z]: yes!!:)
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:28:03.509Z]: so what happens when we take one hundredth of 75?
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:28:13.889Z]: what do u mean?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:28:48.803Z]: ok one moment let me show you
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:29:10.024Z]: ok:)

Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:29:30.134Z]: thats confusing lol
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:29:50.595Z]: yeah it can be but lets focus on the first step
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:30:10.857Z]: ok
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:30:20.796Z]: whats the first step
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:30:33.594Z]: so what are they doing inthe first step? hold on one moment
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:30:57.187Z]: ok:)
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:31:04.765Z]: ![Image](https://content.thinkthroughmath.com/live_teaching_images%2Fcb9720ac-904f-4361-a3ba-4c8caee261ea%2F3.JPG)
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:31:17.158Z]: highlighted part
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:32:37.853Z]: it says 3 times 25(0.1)=75(0.1)
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:33:29.759Z]: yes so on the left side when we multiply 25 x (0.1) =?
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:34:12.520Z]: =2.5
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:34:31.898Z]: super!
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:34:46.489Z]: :)
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:35:03.927Z]: so we know multiplying a number by 1/10 moves the decimal point one place to the left
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:35:26.662Z]: I guess
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:36:00.124Z]: I am not a 100% sure if I get this
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:36:50.963Z]: hello

Elijah @ [2018-05-08T21:01:43.525Z]: Yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T21:01:58.588Z]: ok how do you normally add fraction?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T21:02:02.030Z]: fractions?
Elijah @ [2018-05-08T21:03:02.028Z]: I add the numerator and the whole fraction
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T21:03:52.525Z]: So are you saying  you would across the numerators?
Elijah @ [2018-05-08T21:04:11.851Z]: Yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T21:04:36.905Z]: so what about the denominators?
Elijah @ [2018-05-08T21:04:49.873Z]: I don't get how to get the denominator
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T21:05:43.478Z]: ok so do the denominators have to be the same?
Elijah @ [2018-05-08T21:05:53.236Z]: Like the numerator is 21 but I don't know how to find the denominator
Elijah @ [2018-05-08T21:06:03.607Z]: Yes they do
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T21:06:21.105Z]: do you know how we can find the common denominators?
Elijah @ [2018-05-08T21:06:40.226Z]: Do we have to always keep the bigger number
Elijah @ [2018-05-08T21:06:51.880Z]: *numerator
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T21:07:06.996Z]: well answer my question first so we dont get confused
Elijah @ [2018-05-08T21:08:26.346Z]: I don't know how I can find the common denominator
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T21:08:48.385Z]: ok Let's take a look at an example together.
Elijah @ [2018-05-08T21:08:57.907Z]: Ok

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T21:11:28.668Z]: ok so now we need to find a common denominator
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T21:11:36.785Z]: well how did you get that?
Elijah @ [2018-05-08T21:12:10.019Z]: I added the numerators and the biggest denominator
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T21:13:25.047Z]: ok well in order to find the common denominator we have to find a common multiple for both
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T21:13:41.132Z]: list some mutiples for 5 and 3
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T21:13:50.353Z]: well start with

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:01:52.899Z]: Hi! Let's look over your problem again. Would you like me to type or talk?
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:02:03.944Z]: type please
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:02:26.707Z]: ok What do you already know that might be useful here?
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:02:58.312Z]: what?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:03:14.072Z]: what do you already know that can help you?
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:03:57.894Z]: ummm
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:04:07.503Z]: It is okay if you do not know! We can work together to find out.
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:04:27.438Z]: that it gives us the kind of fractions
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:05:37.417Z]: yes it does
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:06:02.233Z]: so what do you have to change the mixed numbers to?
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:06:25.458Z]: i dont know
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:07:13.162Z]: It really helps to read or listen to the problem carefully. Are you able to do that?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:07:19.371Z]: It tells you :)
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:08:58.776Z]: i know but how do i change a mixed # into a fraction
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:09:40.416Z]: ok Let's take a look at an example together.
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:10:26.020Z]: O:D
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:11:18.938Z]: ok:-)
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:13:18.601Z]: so do you understand this is mixed fraction?
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:13:29.781Z]: yes i think
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:14:42.930Z]: ok so what comes to mind when making this a fraction?
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:14:42.938Z]: can you let me show you what it equals
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:14:50.336Z]: sure
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:15:42.338Z]: there
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:16:02.515Z]: Not quite, but good effort! Let's work together to figure this out.
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:16:08.077Z]: ok
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:16:42.830Z]: so what do we do?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:17:22.275Z]: first we have to multiple the denominator with the whole number
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:17:26.171Z]: its gonna be 15
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:17:40.003Z]: yes i know this part
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:17:44.744Z]: super!
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:17:56.407Z]: so how did you get that?
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:18:19.344Z]: i got 15/10 becouse
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:19:01.438Z]: i multiply 1 and 10 wich equals 10 +5 equels 15
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:19:20.224Z]: and we leave the denominator the same
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:19:23.392Z]: super!
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:20:36.064Z]: so how can you apply this strategy with this problem
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:22:07.116Z]: i just dont know on the problem what mixed number im suppose to turn into a fraction.
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:22:47.035Z]: well first you have to identify the mixed numbers
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:22:52.854Z]: so lets look at the first one
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:22:59.709Z]: ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:23:01.713Z]: what is the mixed number?
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:23:32.958Z]: 2 3/12
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:25:06.153Z]: 2 3/12 right
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:25:16.577Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:25:46.459Z]: so how would you make it into a fraction like you just showed me?
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:25:53.319Z]: the total is going to be 27/12
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:25:58.999Z]: right
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:26:34.460Z]: perfect!!
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:26:41.725Z]: now I think you have it from here! Keep up the awesome work!
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:26:47.851Z]: Please come back if you need more help. Have a nice day!

Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:20:01.683Z]: I need my glasses
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:20:45.164Z]: ok
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:21:03.224Z]: back
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:21:06.840Z]: pk
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:21:08.305Z]: ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:21:19.738Z]: so lets walk through this step by step
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:21:40.662Z]: what does the first statement mean to u?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:22:03.775Z]: Make the statement in simple words :)
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:22:07.472Z]: Numbers
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:22:10.871Z]: nothing
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:22:34.552Z]: I don't see how I can relate that to an equation of a circle
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:24:07.982Z]: ok well in the example they give you, they want you to know what a standard form of the equation looks like
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:24:56.863Z]: meaning that within this equation you find the center of the circle and the radius
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:24:56.916Z]: ohh looking at two different things
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:25:12.492Z]: ok can you say more about that?
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:25:42.397Z]: I was looking at where it says example. That equation.
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:25:52.514Z]: oh ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:26:03.551Z]: yes but the statement above it is also helpful
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:26:20.345Z]: no they take the Example equation and they start to break it down
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:26:24.051Z]: what do they do first?
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:27:09.109Z]: I have no clue... Where did the 9 come from?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:27:36.999Z]: good question about the 9! lets think about this
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:27:52.763Z]: what does it mean to complete the square?
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:28:52.127Z]: to like answer it?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:29:14.570Z]: yes
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:29:40.535Z]: but there's no 3
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:31:28.115Z]: so why would you need a 3? show me on the whiteboard
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:32:10.039Z]: because if you complete the square to get 9 you need a 3
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:33:52.095Z]: yes but remember that x^2 is the same as what?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:34:06.372Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:34:45.693Z]: but when you complete the square, what do you get?
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:35:15.322Z]: I don't know what x is
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:35:22.958Z]: (x)(x)
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:35:56.068Z]: ((X)(X)-6)

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:47:33.242Z]: you can think of **rounding** as skip counting. for example, if you count by 10's, what will be closest to 193 ? *...0, 10, 20, 30, ...*

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:49:58.886Z]: Right :) If we count by 10's to round to the nearest ten, what would be count by to round to the nearest thousand?
Jolie @ [2018-05-08T15:50:26.861Z]: 100?
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:50:31.700Z]: Please think about what we just talked about :)

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:51:31.274Z]: Do you see that to round to the nearest ten, we counted by 10's?

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:52:02.604Z]: So what would we count by if we are rounding to the nearest thousand?
Jolie @ [2018-05-08T15:52:19.056Z]: 1,000

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:11:44.463Z]: Hi! Let's look over your problem again. Would you like me to type or talk?
RAWLSTON @ [2018-05-09T21:12:16.059Z]: what is 7 halfs = to
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:12:20.877Z]: what does a denominator *(the bottom of a fraction)* tell us about a whole object?
RAWLSTON @ [2018-05-09T21:12:54.819Z]: a denominator is the whole
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:13:02.342Z]: Okay, for example, how many equal parts would 3/4 have in 1 whole?
RAWLSTON @ [2018-05-09T21:13:21.488Z]: 4 fourths
RAWLSTON @ [2018-05-09T21:13:33.715Z]: i dont know that much
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:13:42.296Z]: Right! :) So for example, if we have 8/4...how many wholes can we make?
RAWLSTON @ [2018-05-09T21:13:51.019Z]: 2
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:14:01.446Z]: How do you know?
RAWLSTON @ [2018-05-09T21:14:24.931Z]: because 2 times 4 = 8
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:14:36.729Z]: Okay, look at 9/4... how many wjholes can we make?
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:14:39.038Z]: wholes*
RAWLSTON @ [2018-05-09T21:14:44.277Z]: 5
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:15:12.997Z]: Not exactly, how many parts make up 1 whole in 9/4?
RAWLSTON @ [2018-05-09T21:16:25.397Z]: i forgot what it is scence 3rd grade
RAWLSTON @ [2018-05-09T21:16:45.311Z]: sence
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:16:51.612Z]: Please think about what we just talked about :)
RAWLSTON @ [2018-05-09T21:18:20.479Z]: 2 and 1/4
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:18:29.400Z]: How do you know? :)

Lexi @ [2018-05-08T14:34:13.982Z]: type plz
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:34:40.615Z]: here's a small example to help you with this problem. what does 10 - 8 = ?
Lexi @ [2018-05-08T14:35:59.660Z]: 2
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:36:05.875Z]: how can you use math to check that 10 - 8 = 2 ?
Lexi @ [2018-05-08T14:36:20.753Z]: you add 2 plus 8
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:36:39.312Z]: so if 10 - 8 = 2, then 2 + 8 = 10. some people refer to this as a 'fact' or 'fact family,' okay?
Lexi @ [2018-05-08T14:36:52.711Z]: Okay.
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:37:15.554Z]: Did you know that you can use that same thinking here?
Lexi @ [2018-05-08T14:37:46.565Z]: Yes, and I've tried using the method, but it won't work!
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:38:01.872Z]: why
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:38:03.058Z]: ?
Lexi @ [2018-05-08T14:38:26.275Z]: I don't know, it's just hard
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:38:50.389Z]: if 10 - n = 8, then what is another fact we can say?
Lexi @ [2018-05-08T14:39:34.860Z]: N plus 8 will equal 10?
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:40:18.752Z]: Great! :) so then what has to be true about the sum of the answer Natasha has and 5/7?
Lexi @ [2018-05-08T14:40:44.564Z]: It has to equal 1 and 1/3.

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:58:17.484Z]: Hi! Let's look over your problem again. Your device does not support chat audio. We need to type. Ready?
Evolet @ [2018-05-08T14:58:58.664Z]: yes!😃
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:59:10.523Z]: What does this problem ask you to find? :)
Evolet @ [2018-05-08T15:00:50.521Z]: To drag each number to a container to show whether it is equivalent to 12\4,12\3,or 3\3
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:01:01.826Z]: Right, what does a denominator *(the bottom of a fraction)* tell us about a whole object?
Evolet @ [2018-05-08T15:01:51.382Z]: how many total pieces there are
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:02:18.948Z]: Right! :) for example, how many equal parts would 3/4 have in 1 whole?
Evolet @ [2018-05-08T15:02:52.448Z]: 4
Evolet @ [2018-05-08T15:02:58.389Z]: ???
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:03:09.441Z]: Great! :) So if we have the fraction 8/4... how many wholes is that?
Evolet @ [2018-05-08T15:03:17.354Z]: 8
Evolet @ [2018-05-08T15:03:37.851Z]: ???
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:04:28.839Z]: Please think about what we just talked about :)
Evolet @ [2018-05-08T15:04:42.671Z]: ohh 4
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:04:55.574Z]: The 4 tells us how many parts make up 1 whole... right?
Evolet @ [2018-05-08T15:05:07.499Z]: 😐
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:05:19.930Z]: Please answer my question so I can help you with this problem :)
Evolet @ [2018-05-08T15:05:23.084Z]: ohh yeah!
Evolet @ [2018-05-08T15:05:39.331Z]: Sorry!:(
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:05:42.202Z]: Okay, so then if we have 8/4... how many groups of 4 can we make?
Evolet @ [2018-05-08T15:05:51.296Z]: 2
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:06:16.966Z]: Right! so how many wholes does 8/4 mean?
Evolet @ [2018-05-08T15:06:23.106Z]: 4
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:06:44.859Z]: Please think about what we just talked about :)
Evolet @ [2018-05-08T15:06:49.182Z]: or 8
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:07:10.423Z]: 8/4... the 4 is how many part make up 1 whole... what does the 8 mean?
Evolet @ [2018-05-08T15:07:35.832Z]: the number of equal parts
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:07:53.714Z]: That is how many parts we have right?
Evolet @ [2018-05-08T15:08:01.577Z]: yes
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:09:03.935Z]: So if we have 8 total parts... and we know to have 1 whole, we need 4 parts, how many wholes can we make?
Evolet @ [2018-05-08T15:09:20.127Z]: 4??
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:09:42.049Z]: Not exactly,
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:10:06.538Z]: How many circles do we have on the whiteboard
Evolet @ [2018-05-08T15:10:18.465Z]: 8
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:10:46.185Z]: Yes, If we know that 4 parts make up 1 whole... can you make groups of 4?
Evolet @ [2018-05-08T15:11:39.890Z]: yes
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:11:46.891Z]: Show me on the whiteboard
Evolet @ [2018-05-08T15:12:02.428Z]: thare
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:12:36.684Z]: Great! How many wholes were you able to make?
Evolet @ [2018-05-08T15:12:43.953Z]: 2
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:13:08.600Z]: Right! So then 8/4 is the same as making 2 wholes.. does that make sebse&gt;
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:13:09.792Z]: sense*

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:39:49.319Z]: Hi! Let's look over your problem again. Would you like me to type or talk?
Katherine @ [2018-05-08T14:40:20.166Z]: Hello can you type please?
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:40:34.516Z]: Sure! What does this problem ask you to find? :)
Katherine @ [2018-05-08T14:41:26.632Z]: Ten over two equals blank one
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:41:53.416Z]: Right, here is a similar example: 12 / 4 = [ ] / 1. what did i do to the 4 to GET 1?
Katherine @ [2018-05-08T14:42:56.439Z]: I'm sorry I have no clue what that problem means?
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:43:16.877Z]: It is just like your problem, but with different numbers... do you see that? :)
Katherine @ [2018-05-08T14:44:20.263Z]: Yes but I mean  like the random symbols (sorry if spelled wrong)
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:45:03.398Z]: It is showing us that 12/4 is the same as [ ] /1
Katherine @ [2018-05-08T14:46:50.004Z]: Oh ok it just looked cunfusing with the symbols (sorry if things are spelled wrong gain)
Katherine @ [2018-05-08T14:47:03.595Z]: again*
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:47:10.563Z]: That's okay :) So what can we do with the 4 to get to 1
Katherine @ [2018-05-08T14:48:51.756Z]: Take out 3 out of the four to make one? =(
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:49:41.774Z]: Oka,y what other math could you use besides subtration?
Katherine @ [2018-05-08T14:51:28.829Z]: Mulitplycation (again sorry if spelled wrong)
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:52:06.782Z]: what can we multiply 4 by to get 1
Katherine @ [2018-05-08T14:52:52.510Z]: Nothing
Katherine @ [2018-05-08T14:53:26.476Z]: So we would have to add
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:53:32.048Z]: right, so we cannot use multiplication, what can we ad
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:53:32.951Z]: add
Katherine @ [2018-05-08T14:54:02.444Z]: 0+1=1
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:54:34.810Z]: Do you see that we cannot add anything to 4 to get 1?
Katherine @ [2018-05-08T14:54:54.736Z]: Oh..yes
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:55:18.344Z]: So then the only other operation that is left is division...what can we divide 4 by to get 1?
Katherine @ [2018-05-08T14:56:33.734Z]: .....Um I don't really know?
Katherine @ [2018-05-08T14:56:40.081Z]: Sorry
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:57:12.375Z]: Please give it a try! It is okay to make mistakes.
Katherine @ [2018-05-08T14:57:29.838Z]: I was going to say 4x1
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:58:35.415Z]: do you see that we can divide: 4 ÷ 4= 1
Katherine @ [2018-05-08T14:59:28.480Z]: Kinda..
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T14:59:50.669Z]: So if we divide the bottom by 4, we need to divide the top by 4... so what is the same as 12/4 ?
Katherine @ [2018-05-08T15:00:34.355Z]: 6/1 ?
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:00:46.254Z]: Please think about what we just talked about :)
Katherine @ [2018-05-08T15:01:47.152Z]: Can I have a second
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:02:34.715Z]: Sure

Jayla @ [2018-05-09T21:56:49.899Z]: type so the frist ones are ones right
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:57:15.881Z]: why do you think that? :)
Jayla @ [2018-05-09T21:58:17.171Z]: can you see what im working on
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:58:28.700Z]: Yes
Jayla @ [2018-05-09T21:59:06.488Z]: so you see what i put
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:59:34.105Z]: I can only see what you have when you clicked in
Jayla @ [2018-05-09T22:00:45.990Z]: so you can't see my math problem
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:01:10.132Z]: I can see the problem, but only the answer you had when you clicked in
Jayla @ [2018-05-09T22:01:28.926Z]: oh
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:01:51.678Z]: Why do you think the first answers are ones?
Jayla @ [2018-05-09T22:02:41.548Z]: yes so  the 8 in 18 i in the ones place
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:03:48.755Z]: Right, what if we had 150 ÷ 3... how many groups of 15 can we make?
Jayla @ [2018-05-09T22:04:23.251Z]: 5
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:04:35.182Z]: Not exactly, try again :)
Jayla @ [2018-05-09T22:04:59.244Z]: 10
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:05:47.950Z]: Right! :) So if we have groups of 15... how many will go in each of 3 groups?
Jayla @ [2018-05-09T22:06:26.839Z]: 5
Jayla @ [2018-05-09T22:06:39.004Z]: or 10
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:06:58.700Z]: Which one?
Jayla @ [2018-05-09T22:07:07.022Z]: 1
Jayla @ [2018-05-09T22:07:11.190Z]: 10
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:08:07.872Z]: Do you see that we can can make 3 groups of 50 to get 150?
Jayla @ [2018-05-09T22:09:32.232Z]: this is hard i give up
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:09:59.650Z]: Don't give up! :)Think of it this way:  How many groups of 10 make up 150?
Jayla @ [2018-05-09T22:10:38.148Z]: 3
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:10:54.532Z]: Not exactly, if you break 150 into groups of 10, how many can you make?
Jayla @ [2018-05-09T22:11:37.694Z]: 15
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:11:46.661Z]: Right! :) So if we split the 15 tens into groups of 3, how many tens will be in each group?
Jayla @ [2018-05-09T22:13:13.182Z]: 5
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:13:31.682Z]: Great! :) So then 150 ÷ 3 is the same as 5 tens or 50. make sense?
Jayla @ [2018-05-09T22:14:31.717Z]: im ok whit it

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:11:47.924Z]: Hi! Let's look over your problem again. Would you like me to type or talk?
Maya @ [2018-05-09T22:11:52.690Z]: type
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:12:26.278Z]: what must be true about the result in the correct choice?
Maya @ [2018-05-09T22:12:45.750Z]: it has to be greater than 1
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:13:07.552Z]: Right! Look at the choice you chose... is 2/5 more or less than 1/2?
Maya @ [2018-05-09T22:13:17.932Z]: more
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:13:36.788Z]: what does a denominator *(the bottom of a fraction)* tell us about a whole object?
Maya @ [2018-05-09T22:13:51.796Z]: how big it is
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:14:01.950Z]: for example, how many equal parts would 3/4 have in 1 whole?
Maya @ [2018-05-09T22:14:09.448Z]: 2
Maya @ [2018-05-09T22:14:11.395Z]: 3
Maya @ [2018-05-09T22:14:14.759Z]: 3 parts
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:14:32.294Z]: Please think about what we just talked about :)
Maya @ [2018-05-09T22:14:52.894Z]: then 4 equal parts?
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:15:26.196Z]: Right! So then if we have a denominator of 4... what fraction would mean the same as 1/2
Maya @ [2018-05-09T22:16:09.814Z]: 2/4?
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:16:25.509Z]: Right! How do you know?
Maya @ [2018-05-09T22:16:41.727Z]: because you can divide to find them
Maya @ [2018-05-09T22:16:47.791Z]: like reduce them
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:17:17.370Z]: Do you see that 2 is **half** of 4
Maya @ [2018-05-09T22:17:22.475Z]: yes
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:18:20.293Z]: Okay, now think of 2/5... is the more or less than 1/2?
Maya @ [2018-05-09T22:18:46.427Z]: more?
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:19:21.893Z]: If the denominator is 5... what amount is half of 5?
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T22:21:52.856Z]: Are you still there?

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:07:30.587Z]: What does this problem ask you to find? :)
Madison @ [2018-05-08T15:08:12.570Z]: D is one mark before number 4
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:08:46.207Z]: Right, what numbers do you see on the number line?
Madison @ [2018-05-08T15:10:19.358Z]: 0 at the beging and then three empty lines and then 4.
Madison @ [2018-05-08T15:10:54.182Z]: I have to figure out what is D
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:10:57.672Z]: Right, so what numbers should the lines between 0 and 4 have to be?
Madison @ [2018-05-08T15:11:49.330Z]: 1/4, 2/4, 3/4 and then 4
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:12:12.345Z]: Not exactly, what numbers do you count between 0 and 4
Madison @ [2018-05-08T15:12:31.825Z]: 1, 2, 3
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:12:47.752Z]: Yes! :) How do we make any whole number a fraction?
Madison @ [2018-05-08T15:13:07.727Z]: Divide?
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:13:13.921Z]: How?
Madison @ [2018-05-08T15:14:18.613Z]: 4 divided by 1, 2, or 3
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:14:48.196Z]: Have you taken a look at **math help 2** yet? :)

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-10T00:55:46.723Z]: What does **math help 2** tell us about our answer when we **divide** the same top number by the same bottom number in a fraction?
ASHER @ [2018-05-10T00:59:25.923Z]: Dividing the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same number will have an equivalent fraction
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-10T00:59:43.456Z]: For example: 3/3 = ?
ASHER @ [2018-05-10T01:00:09.817Z]: 1 whole.
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-10T01:00:17.189Z]: So then if we have 6/8 ÷ 1, we can say that the value of the fraction does **not** change. Right?
ASHER @ [2018-05-10T01:00:39.603Z]: Yeah.
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-10T01:00:45.627Z]: We can also say that since we know the 2/2 = 1, that 6/8 ÷ 2/2  also does **not** change the value of the fraction. Make sense? :).

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:33:09.336Z]: How many acres are there in the first 4 lots in total?

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:33:48.058Z]: Not exactly, what math can we use to find out?

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:35:55.883Z]: right! How is that more or less than 2 wholes

Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:36:31.942Z]: Sorry
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:36:33.502Z]: Is it more than 2 wholes?

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:36:53.495Z]: what does the 4 in 9/4 tell us?

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:37:55.850Z]: Yes, so if we have **9**/4... can we make more than 1 whole?
Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:38:09.090Z]: Yes
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:38:55.687Z]: can we make more than 2 wholes?
Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:39:11.488Z]: No
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:39:37.965Z]: but we know that the 4 tells us how much makes up 1 whole, right
Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:39:45.631Z]: Yes
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:39:58.898Z]: And 4/4 is 1 whole.... what fraction is the same as 2 whoels?
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:40:00.701Z]: wholes*
Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:41:18.794Z]: ummmmmmmm...
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:41:46.527Z]: Please give it a try! It is okay to make mistakes.
Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:41:50.927Z]: It’s hard
Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:42:10.683Z]: I don’t know
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:42:23.941Z]: Do you see that **8**/4 would be the same as 2 wholes?
Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:42:33.677Z]: No
Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:42:41.468Z]: How
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:43:30.955Z]: the 4 tells us how many parts will make up 1 whole. So **4**/4 tells us we have 4 parts out of 4 parts... good so far?
Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:44:34.912Z]: Oh I get it because 4+4=8 two wholes would be 8/4
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:44:59.820Z]: Right! :)
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:45:05.025Z]: So then is 9/4 more or less than 8/4?
Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:45:33.182Z]: More so it is bigger than two wholes

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T17:51:08.032Z]: Hi! What does this problem ask you to find? :)
MADISON @ [2018-05-08T17:51:17.229Z]: May I ask you a few questions?
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T17:51:24.026Z]: Sure
MADISON @ [2018-05-08T17:51:45.532Z]: When the question asks,

MADISON @ [2018-05-08T17:55:36.089Z]: What is diagonal?
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T17:56:14.354Z]: It is a direction... so the direction of the green boxes go represents a diagonal direction
MADISON @ [2018-05-08T17:56:32.671Z]: Ohhh,
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T17:56:53.987Z]: :)
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T17:56:57.090Z]: Does that help?
MADISON @ [2018-05-08T17:56:59.074Z]: What does it mean when they say from bottom to top??
MADISON @ [2018-05-08T17:57:15.475Z]: Yes,,, that helps alot.

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T18:26:16.005Z]: So how would you write 2  as a fraction for example?

Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-08T20:10:21.595Z]: how would you describe a **midpoint** ?
TUCKER @ [2018-05-08T20:10:52.876Z]: i dont know

TUCKER @ [2018-05-08T20:11:17.157Z]: ok
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-08T20:11:35.558Z]: My friend lives *halfway* between my house and the school.  I can call her home the **midpoint**, what do you think that means?
TUCKER @ [2018-05-08T20:12:04.050Z]: in the middle
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-08T20:12:11.208Z]: that's right, exactly the middle :)

TUCKER @ [2018-05-08T20:14:20.263Z]: would it be on the bottom
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-08T20:14:39.137Z]: right, we're going to move the same distance from A to B but in the opposite direction
TUCKER @ [2018-05-08T20:14:58.401Z]: ok
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-08T20:15:00.293Z]: What would the new coordinates be for C

Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-08T20:16:57.916Z]: I like that you kept the x-coordinate the same :)  that's great.  We just want to move one space down on the y though
TUCKER @ [2018-05-08T20:17:37.688Z]: ok

Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T18:58:33.569Z]: What does a denominator tell us about our whole amount?
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T18:58:45.120Z]: ummm
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T18:58:54.961Z]: whatt
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T18:59:02.725Z]: do you mean
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T18:59:03.764Z]: Can you please shade half of this?

Darrell @ [2018-05-09T18:59:21.100Z]: me
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T18:59:28.874Z]: okay get readyy
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T18:59:30.440Z]: okay
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T18:59:44.174Z]: ready :)
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T18:59:51.850Z]: okay
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:00:20.219Z]: right :)  a denominator will tell us how many equal parts our whole is split into. Since our whole is split into 2 equal parts, our denominator has to be a 2.
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:01:38.317Z]: Let's try another example.  Please shade 2/8 for me
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:01:54.143Z]: okay
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:03:56.838Z]: If we had 2/8 used twice, would there be another way to solve it instead of repeated addition?
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:04:07.078Z]: ummmmm
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:04:17.624Z]: yeah what you are doing
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:04:24.588Z]: the smae thing
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:04:35.371Z]: and can you shade the boxes really fast
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:04:42.133Z]: and why is it blue
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:05:23.257Z]: ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:05:37.698Z]: If we wanted to use something other than repeated addition, what would we do?  Addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division?
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:06:08.960Z]: for example, if I had  2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10, would there be another way to solve it instead of repeated addition?
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:06:27.401Z]: wait can you answer my qustion
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:06:29.152Z]: plz
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:06:30.365Z]: plz
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:06:57.992Z]: can you shade the boxes really fast and why is it blue
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:07:03.188Z]: Yes, :)  the teachers have colors we can choose from
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:07:16.759Z]: oh can you put red i want to see it
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:07:27.938Z]: i never see it on think trought math
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:07:35.344Z]: through math i mean
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:07:51.225Z]: okay let get started
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:07:58.709Z]: Did you see my question above? for example, if I had 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10, would there be another way to solve it instead of repeated addition?
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:08:11.385Z]: yes
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:08:32.192Z]: Great, what could we do instead?
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:08:50.297Z]: you could Multiple
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:09:10.778Z]: perfect strategy :)

Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:10:46.229Z]: i dont get this that much bc i dont know how you got 2
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:10:51.508Z]: WHen you told me 2 x 5... how did you get the 5 ?
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:11:19.175Z]: wow thats just so rude
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:11:37.294Z]: I would like to help you. Are you ready to work on this together?
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:12:03.472Z]: i do to but not like you told i just fell like i just got rusted
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:12:41.266Z]: You're doing fine, let's just use what you told me to see how I got mine.  When we had 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 we said it was 2 x 5... where did the 5 come from?
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:14:10.121Z]: yeah but were did you get the 2 from
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:14:48.766Z]: The same way you got the 5 :)  when we adding two for 5 times, we multiply 2 x **5**.  In my example, how many times are we adding 2/8 ?
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:16:00.972Z]: no im  talkingy babo0u6t the4 5
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:17:56.518Z]: I'm not sure I understand that, can you explain your thinking to me?

Sabella @ [2018-05-10T20:06:19.083Z]: I do not know
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-10T20:06:41.355Z]: Okay, for example, my young children depend on me to make their food and clean their clothes... they cannot do it without me... what do you think 'dependent' means?
Sabella @ [2018-05-10T20:07:50.508Z]: Oh, sorry! I think dependent means to depend on somebody or something
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-10T20:08:04.662Z]: :) absolutely! it works the same in math... dependent qualities need something else to make sense and independent make sense on their own
Sabella @ [2018-05-10T20:08:45.741Z]: Oh ok, I thought there would be a math definition that was different.
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-10T20:09:36.129Z]: Luckily this time they work the same way :)  for example, apples are $2.25 per pound. Since I need to know the amount of pounds I have in order to find the price... is this dependent or independent ?
Sabella @ [2018-05-10T20:09:55.623Z]: Dependent?
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-10T20:10:54.826Z]: :) absolutely!
Sabella @ [2018-05-10T20:11:05.421Z]: Yay!!
Sabella @ [2018-05-10T20:12:06.706Z]: How do you know if a number is independent or dependent
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-10T20:12:29.025Z]: Let's use our example to see
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-10T20:12:52.165Z]: If I say I have 5 apples, does it depend on anything else to find it (like finding the price did) ?
Sabella @ [2018-05-10T20:13:05.880Z]: No.
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-10T20:13:35.473Z]: You're right, so just a single number, (the number of apples) is independent... it doesn't need anything else to find it
Sabella @ [2018-05-10T20:14:22.996Z]: ok
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-10T20:14:40.951Z]: I think you have it from here! Keep up the awesome work! See if you can use what we did to try this on your own.
Sabella @ [2018-05-10T20:14:53.640Z]: This equation above is dependent, right?

Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-10T18:29:52.744Z]: That's a great way to think of it, yes because they are about the same... at least we use the same kind of terms
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-10T18:30:03.011Z]: We don't mix variables and regular numbers
Robledo @ [2018-05-10T18:30:29.356Z]: that is ok

Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T18:17:03.229Z]: How many correct choices does the problem tell you to select?
GABRIELA @ [2018-05-08T18:17:35.567Z]: oh it says 3 choices

Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T18:18:16.865Z]: Do you see 3 answers that will equal the number 24 ?
GABRIELA @ [2018-05-08T18:19:04.396Z]: well i do not get number three of the questions
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T18:19:56.433Z]: Let's look at the first answer choice
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T18:19:59.905Z]: (2x3)x4
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T18:20:07.274Z]: What will you multiply there **First** ?
GABRIELA @ [2018-05-08T18:20:26.429Z]: like (2x3) + (2x4)
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T18:20:46.248Z]: well does that one equal 24 ?
GABRIELA @ [2018-05-08T18:21:00.213Z]: um i dont know what you mean
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T18:22:04.302Z]: Well what do you do *first* to simlify that?
GABRIELA @ [2018-05-08T18:22:55.527Z]: can i draw to show you what i am confused about and i dont know what simlyfy means
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T18:23:26.459Z]: ok try to draw it
GABRIELA @ [2018-05-08T18:24:06.465Z]: so you add those

Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T18:25:35.743Z]: right
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T18:25:44.470Z]: So does that one equal 24 ?
GABRIELA @ [2018-05-08T18:25:50.369Z]: to long of a 4
GABRIELA @ [2018-05-08T18:26:03.956Z]: no
GABRIELA @ [2018-05-08T18:26:15.792Z]: can we erase
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T18:26:20.121Z]: right so (2 × 3) + (2 × 4) is **not** correct
GABRIELA @ [2018-05-08T18:26:21.411Z]: this mess
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T18:26:34.770Z]: Now can you try this one?

CHIBUZO @ [2018-05-10T14:35:46.537Z]: talk
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:35:58.698Z]: Did you hear my voice?
CHIBUZO @ [2018-05-10T14:36:04.471Z]: no
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:36:47.323Z]: It seems you can't hear me... I'll type instead :)
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:36:52.805Z]: What fraction do we want our answer to equal?
CHIBUZO @ [2018-05-10T14:37:03.743Z]: 2/5
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:37:12.022Z]: That's right
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:37:17.432Z]: And what denominator do we want to change that to?
CHIBUZO @ [2018-05-10T14:38:20.472Z]: i think 10
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:38:47.643Z]: not quite... Read the problem again carefully, please
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:38:53.262Z]: A fraction has ☐ as its denominator
CHIBUZO @ [2018-05-10T14:39:01.082Z]: oh yes its 20
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:39:19.776Z]: Very good
CHIBUZO @ [2018-05-10T14:39:28.196Z]: thanks
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:39:28.507Z]: How do we change 2/5 to a denominator of 20?
CHIBUZO @ [2018-05-10T14:39:44.167Z]: 5 times 4
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:40:21.620Z]: that's right, so what will we also do to the numerator?
CHIBUZO @ [2018-05-10T14:40:32.501Z]: 2 times 2
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:40:49.483Z]: well if we multiply the denominator by 4, what should we do to the numerator?
CHIBUZO @ [2018-05-10T14:41:06.827Z]: we should m
CHIBUZO @ [2018-05-10T14:41:36.723Z]: we should multiply it by 2
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:41:41.002Z]: not quite... pic.
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:41:42.534Z]: Let me show you a picture that may help.
CHIBUZO @ [2018-05-10T14:42:28.472Z]: i should multiply it by 4
CHIBUZO @ [2018-05-10T14:43:03.251Z]: and it would equal 8
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:43:05.884Z]: right!
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:43:13.205Z]: Do you have any questions before you continue on your own?
CHIBUZO @ [2018-05-10T14:43:24.010Z]: so it would be 8/20
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:43:31.986Z]: you're right good work
CHIBUZO @ [2018-05-10T14:44:31.241Z]: so it would equal 4/10
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:45:05.498Z]: no you want to choose the model that shows 8/20
CHIBUZO @ [2018-05-10T14:45:06.147Z]: be back in a min its time to go get lunch
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:45:14.672Z]: Please come back if you need more help. Have a nice day!

Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T17:45:42.467Z]: hi :)
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T17:45:47.315Z]: Please type one of the answer choices for me, and we'll go over that one as an example.
Bradline @ [2018-05-08T17:46:48.058Z]: 1,5,9,13,17,....
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T17:47:41.656Z]: So how much do the numbers change when you go from 1 to 5 ?
Bradline @ [2018-05-08T17:48:24.307Z]: It stops at 5
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T17:48:56.308Z]: think of it this way: 1  + ☐ = 5

Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T17:49:26.888Z]: Then 5 + ☐ = 9

Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T17:50:01.490Z]: that's right
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T17:50:05.736Z]: 9 + ☐ = 13 ?
Bradline @ [2018-05-08T17:50:14.520Z]: 4
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T17:51:13.488Z]: right
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T17:51:20.772Z]: So does that pattern use a rule of 'add 4' ?

Angel @ [2018-05-08T15:36:32.982Z]: i dont know
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T15:36:40.220Z]: what whole number x what fraction?
Angel @ [2018-05-08T15:36:58.001Z]: its dragging expressions into order
Angel @ [2018-05-08T15:37:11.500Z]: 3 times 2 over 5
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T15:37:47.078Z]: that's right
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T15:38:03.246Z]: So that's what the first number line is showing: 3 boxes with 2/5 in each box.... Does that make sense?
Angel @ [2018-05-08T15:38:57.323Z]: i get the 3 part but i dont get the 2/5 part
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T15:39:46.500Z]: how many spaces are between 0 and 1 on that number line?
Angel @ [2018-05-08T15:40:00.663Z]: 5
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T15:40:19.591Z]: very good
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T15:40:28.366Z]: And how many spaces wide is 1 of those arrows?

Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T15:41:16.704Z]: great!
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T15:41:27.991Z]: So now let's look at the second number line... How many boxes are in that picture?
Angel @ [2018-05-08T15:41:41.521Z]: 3
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T15:42:21.354Z]: that's right
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T15:42:26.209Z]: How many arrows in each box?

Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T15:42:59.017Z]: very good, and what fraction does each arrow represent?
Angel @ [2018-05-08T15:43:21.419Z]: 1?
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T15:43:37.620Z]: 1/ ☐ ?
Angel @ [2018-05-08T15:43:47.980Z]: oh 1/2
Angel @ [2018-05-08T15:44:40.586Z]: wait no its 1/3 or 1/2
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T15:44:47.919Z]: no remember how many spaces are between 0 and 1 ?
Angel @ [2018-05-08T15:45:06.101Z]: 1/5
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T15:45:33.840Z]: that's right, so 3 boxes, 2 arrows in each box, and each arrow is 1/5
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T15:45:38.496Z]: What multiplication problem is that showing?
Angel @ [2018-05-08T15:46:10.479Z]: 3X(2X1/5)?
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T15:47:20.508Z]: Exactly!

Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-09T19:40:42.397Z]: right so that's the same as 1/2, right?
Sarai @ [2018-05-09T19:41:03.873Z]: yes :)
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-09T19:41:20.192Z]: So we need to compare each part to 1/2
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-09T19:41:25.546Z]: 3/8 is ☐ than 1/2 ? Greater or Less?
Sarai @ [2018-05-09T19:41:58.881Z]: less
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-09T19:42:15.795Z]: right
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-09T19:42:21.544Z]: 1/4 is ☐ than 1/2 ? Greater or Less?
Sarai @ [2018-05-09T19:42:39.185Z]: less
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-09T19:42:45.889Z]: Good
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-09T19:42:54.551Z]: if we mix two parts that are both less than 1/2, the total will be ☐ than 1 whole?
Sarai @ [2018-05-09T19:43:00.173Z]: thankyou
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-09T19:43:15.181Z]: Do you have any questions before you continue on your own?

Sarai @ [2018-05-09T19:45:28.961Z]: can you go over the steps one more time
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-09T19:46:12.624Z]: Well 3/8 and 1/4 are *both* less than 1/2 ... so that means the total will be less than 1 whole
Sarai @ [2018-05-09T19:46:42.485Z]: thankyou good bye :)

Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T17:37:05.131Z]: What number is close to 98 that is easier to add in your head?

LILY @ [2018-05-08T17:37:56.548Z]: i dont know
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T17:38:10.690Z]: What does  98 round to the nearest ten?
LILY @ [2018-05-08T17:38:22.181Z]: IDK
LILY @ [2018-05-08T17:38:31.524Z]: UMM 90

Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T17:39:06.938Z]: well is 98 closer to 90 or 100?
LILY @ [2018-05-08T17:39:22.356Z]: 100 right?
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T17:40:03.698Z]: that's right
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T17:40:06.252Z]: If we add 100 instead of adding 98 our answer will be a little bit off. Will our answer be too big or too small?

Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T17:41:16.154Z]: So why is adding 98 so much harder than adding 100?
LILY @ [2018-05-08T17:42:08.794Z]: um becuase it has two numbers
LILY @ [2018-05-08T17:42:21.429Z]: right?
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T17:42:31.948Z]: And what do you have to do when you add a digit and it is more than 10 ?
LILY @ [2018-05-08T17:42:42.333Z]: ummmmmmm
LILY @ [2018-05-08T17:42:44.583Z]: idk

LILY @ [2018-05-08T17:46:02.117Z]: re groop
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T17:46:06.718Z]: Exactly
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T17:46:14.990Z]: So usually when you add 98 to something, you will have to *regroup*

Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:17:56.002Z]: Hi! Let's look over your problem again. Would you like me to type or talk?
David @ [2018-05-10T14:18:31.959Z]: hi,..... ,..type!
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:19:25.508Z]: What digit do we subtract first?
David @ [2018-05-10T14:20:07.537Z]: 3&2 ?
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:20:58.521Z]: that's right, and do you have to regroup to solve that?
David @ [2018-05-10T14:21:25.757Z]: yes! ?
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:21:32.501Z]: Well what does regrouping mean?
David @ [2018-05-10T14:23:17.560Z]: hum,to,....?
David @ [2018-05-10T14:23:49.312Z]: I don't know:(
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:23:58.855Z]: Regrouping is the same as 'borrowing'
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:24:05.710Z]: Do you have to borrow to do 3-2 ?
David @ [2018-05-10T14:24:24.925Z]: no...
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:24:46.466Z]: that's right, so we just have 3-2 = 1 in the first box
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:24:55.390Z]: Now look at the tens place: 2 - ☐ = 6 ?
David @ [2018-05-10T14:26:04.220Z]: nothing = to 2- enethang
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:26:35.668Z]: So since 2 is *less than 6* what do we have to do to solve that?
David @ [2018-05-10T14:26:55.075Z]: BARWO
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:27:22.610Z]: Yes, so after we borrow, what do we write above the 2 ?
David @ [2018-05-10T14:28:26.653Z]: a,hum,a 3
David @ [2018-05-10T14:28:32.222Z]: ?
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:28:36.918Z]: Well we regroup 1 hundred into 10 tens
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:28:40.778Z]: What is 10 tens + 2 tens?
David @ [2018-05-10T14:29:04.164Z]: 30?
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:29:18.825Z]: what is 10 + 2 ?
David @ [2018-05-10T14:29:26.267Z]: 12
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:29:59.708Z]: Right, so after we regroup we write 12 above the 2 .... Does that make sense?
David @ [2018-05-10T14:30:39.110Z]: yes, :(
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:31:40.565Z]: So 12 - ☐ = 6 ?
David @ [2018-05-10T14:32:25.185Z]: 12-5=6
David @ [2018-05-10T14:32:30.548Z]: 5

Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T18:18:35.265Z]: Hi! Let's look over your problem again. Would you like me to type or talk?
Stevie @ [2018-05-08T18:18:46.442Z]: Type
Stevie @ [2018-05-08T18:19:12.415Z]: I need help with questions like these.
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T18:19:33.034Z]: ok, Let's take a look at an example together.
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T18:19:50.103Z]: What does 5.127 round to the tenths place?
Stevie @ [2018-05-08T18:20:06.384Z]: uh, 5.1?
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T18:20:15.501Z]: that's right
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T18:20:33.739Z]: What about 5.927 ?
Stevie @ [2018-05-08T18:20:38.000Z]: can i write?
Stevie @ [2018-05-08T18:20:50.513Z]: can i write the answer?
Stevie @ [2018-05-08T18:21:06.581Z]: um, 5.9
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T18:21:42.512Z]: Ok try writing that one
Stevie @ [2018-05-08T18:22:11.107Z]: yes ma'am. did i get it right?
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T18:22:19.631Z]: Right very good!
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T18:22:41.904Z]: So now does the tenths place **change** when you round 5.■27 to the tenths?
Stevie @ [2018-05-08T18:23:10.142Z]: The tenths place is gone
Stevie @ [2018-05-08T18:23:50.414Z]: so, when it is rounded to the nearest 1 it is 5
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T18:24:08.168Z]: that's true, but no matter **what** is in the tenths place, it will stay the same, right?
Stevie @ [2018-05-08T18:24:37.759Z]: yes ma'am. we can round another way too
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T18:25:17.205Z]: So no matter what is in the space 5.■27 will round to 5.■ to the tenths place
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T18:25:22.827Z]: What about the **hundredths** place?
Stevie @ [2018-05-08T18:25:43.311Z]: it will be the same
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T18:26:08.125Z]: What is in the hundredths digit of 5.■27 ?
Stevie @ [2018-05-08T18:26:47.864Z]: i forgot. was it 4?
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T18:27:02.287Z]: look
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T18:27:03.885Z]: Look at the picture carefully
Stevie @ [2018-05-08T18:32:38.763Z]: 2
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T18:33:56.959Z]: that's' right
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-08T18:34:06.414Z]: What is to the right of the 2 in 5.■27 ?

Mariyah @ [2018-05-09T17:20:06.058Z]: Yep
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T17:20:29.022Z]: Let's look at an example together.
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T17:20:38.057Z]: What is 1/2 of 6?
Mariyah @ [2018-05-09T17:21:11.351Z]: 3, ma'am
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T17:22:03.551Z]: yes, is that more or less than 6?
Mariyah @ [2018-05-09T17:22:12.722Z]: Less.
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T17:23:13.305Z]: Is 1/2 more or less than 1 whole?
Mariyah @ [2018-05-09T17:23:32.973Z]: Less, ma'am.
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T17:24:18.356Z]: So if you multiply by a fraction less than 1... you get just a part of that number
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T17:24:20.890Z]: 1/2 x 6 = 3
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T17:24:26.432Z]: 3 is just a part of 6
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T17:24:28.798Z]: Does that make sense?
Mariyah @ [2018-05-09T17:24:43.538Z]: Yes ma'am.
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T17:25:01.164Z]: Is 7/8 more or less than 1 whole?
Mariyah @ [2018-05-09T17:25:17.737Z]: Less, ma'am
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T17:25:52.593Z]: yes, so if you multiply 7/8 by 1 3/4..
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T17:26:01.763Z]: should the answer be more or less than 1 3/4?
Mariyah @ [2018-05-09T17:26:13.431Z]: More.
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T17:26:39.894Z]: remember that 7/8 is less than 1 whole
Mariyah @ [2018-05-09T17:26:48.703Z]: Oh, less.
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T17:28:01.037Z]: exactly
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T17:28:08.599Z]: just a 'part' of 1 3/4
Mariyah @ [2018-05-09T17:28:11.982Z]: But Miss, I still don't understand how to find the answer. How to prove if his answer is right or wrong.
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T17:29:08.754Z]: You are trying to decide if 9/4 is correct
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T17:29:22.021Z]: What mixed number is 9/4 equal to?
Mariyah @ [2018-05-09T17:29:53.667Z]: Please excuse me miss, I am working out the problem.
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T17:30:17.525Z]: ok
Mariyah @ [2018-05-09T17:30:33.029Z]: 2 1/4? Or is it 1 2/4?
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T17:30:41.250Z]: 2 1/4 is corrrect
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T17:30:48.763Z]: Is that smaller than 1 3/4?
Mariyah @ [2018-05-09T17:31:00.452Z]: No
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T17:31:15.729Z]: correct
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T17:31:42.200Z]: and you know that is 7/8 is less than 1 whole.. the answer must be 'less than' 1 3/4
Mariyah @ [2018-05-09T17:31:58.846Z]: Yes

Jaxon @ [2018-05-09T15:14:10.426Z]: I’m not sure how to multiply this
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T15:14:39.814Z]: What do you multpiply 7 by to make 28?
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T15:14:51.133Z]: You can try it on the whiteboard.
Jaxon @ [2018-05-09T15:15:34.894Z]: I can’t it won’t let me draw for some reason

Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T15:16:05.545Z]: yes
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T15:16:21.573Z]: so what will you multiply 6 by?
Jaxon @ [2018-05-09T15:17:13.154Z]: 4
Jaxon @ [2018-05-09T15:17:24.951Z]: But that equals 24
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T15:17:52.157Z]: yes
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T15:18:07.273Z]: Do you see where 24/28 goes in the problem?
Jaxon @ [2018-05-09T15:18:25.045Z]: Yes
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T15:18:32.986Z]: ok great
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T15:18:37.162Z]: Now try that for 3/4
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T15:18:46.447Z]: make sure you use the common denominator of 28
Jaxon @ [2018-05-09T15:19:12.458Z]: I got the answer now thx for the lesson m’am

Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-07T13:45:01.630Z]: What would the blue number line represent?
Mia @ [2018-05-07T13:45:24.091Z]: less than 1
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-07T13:46:04.560Z]: yes, and is it greater than 3/4?

Mia @ [2018-05-07T13:47:44.611Z]: right?
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-07T13:48:23.430Z]: yes, would the blue show a number like Trevors?
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-07T13:48:36.263Z]: Does he have a number that is greater than 3/4 and less than 1?
Mia @ [2018-05-07T13:49:36.569Z]: yes

Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-07T13:51:40.166Z]: A number line can help you see it.
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-07T13:51:59.974Z]: Does the pink number line show a number that is greater than 1/2, but less than 3/4?
Mia @ [2018-05-07T13:52:06.962Z]: so, if i make a number line it will be easier
Mia @ [2018-05-07T13:52:27.113Z]: no
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-07T13:53:41.162Z]: Look again at the pink number line..
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-07T13:53:52.867Z]: That is more than 1/2 but less than 3.4
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-07T13:53:55.763Z]: sorry 3/4.
Mia @ [2018-05-07T13:55:12.251Z]: yes
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-07T13:56:27.297Z]: ok, so if you subtract that part..

Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-07T13:56:44.341Z]: Think of taking the pink away from the blue.
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-07T13:56:51.425Z]: Look at the part that is left.
Mia @ [2018-05-07T13:57:33.772Z]: it is greater than 1/4

Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-07T13:59:24.378Z]: The pictures in the helps can help you see what is happening.
Mia @ [2018-05-07T14:01:29.869Z]: it will be less than 1/2 because it is one- fourth and a little bit is less than one half
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-07T14:02:01.250Z]: yes, less than 1/2

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T18:48:03.018Z]: Hello! Looking at the scale here, **how** can we balance it?
Zackary @ [2018-05-08T18:48:53.980Z]: by put a hundend on it
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T18:49:15.221Z]: Can you say more about what you mean by that?

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T18:50:37.593Z]: If we put another 100 on to 49, what would our total be?
Zackary @ [2018-05-08T18:50:49.786Z]: 149
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T18:51:10.470Z]: Right! Would our scale be balanced if the right side was 149?
Zackary @ [2018-05-08T18:52:03.570Z]: no it would not be balanced
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T18:52:09.644Z]: You're right, why not?
Zackary @ [2018-05-08T18:52:42.451Z]: bc 113 is less than 149
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T18:53:08.314Z]: Exactly! How can I find the value for x for this scale to be balanced?
Zackary @ [2018-05-08T18:53:24.038Z]: idk
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T18:53:30.966Z]: Please give it a try! It is okay to make mistakes.
Zackary @ [2018-05-08T18:53:51.193Z]: ok

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-07T22:23:19.052Z]: No you were ok! :) It would have no value if the point was exactly on 0. If the point is just **close** to 0, what does that tell you about the size?
Jasmine @ [2018-05-07T22:24:18.050Z]: MS ASNSWER MY QUESTION PLEASE, and that it's close to no value
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-07T22:24:43.845Z]: I did answer your question :) And you're right! So what does that tell you about the size raisins of point C if it is close to 0?

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T16:04:57.914Z]: You're right! So what would be my total?

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T16:09:25.174Z]: Ok! For the first box, you can only put the expression(s) that would match the given expression being fully simplified. Does that make sense?

Amiee @ [2018-05-08T16:11:55.489Z]: right???
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T16:12:35.044Z]: Great thinking! How can we simplify that

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T15:11:10.191Z]: Great work! So how would 825 round to the nearest hundreds place?
Sofia @ [2018-05-08T15:11:58.447Z]: 800
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T15:12:43.328Z]: Awesome Sofia! How can we use what we talked about to find the **greatest** number listed there that would round to 800?

Sofia @ [2018-05-08T15:16:51.670Z]: the largest number that can round to 800
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T15:18:24.393Z]: Exactly! So would 750 be the biggest number on our list that would round to 800?
Sofia @ [2018-05-08T15:19:05.415Z]: YES! [=
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T15:19:52.741Z]: How can you prove that?

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T00:31:19.910Z]: Awesome! So how can I use a fraction to represent the value of **each section** out of the total?
Sophie @ [2018-05-08T00:33:53.816Z]: I don't know???
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T00:34:08.251Z]: Let's use a picture, one moment

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T00:40:38.889Z]: Right! I put a square on the board to show it is the square garden with 4 sections. Does that make sense?
Sophie @ [2018-05-08T00:41:12.908Z]: not really
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T00:41:26.783Z]: Which part does not make sense?

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T00:43:59.315Z]: Great! So we're trying to focus on **each section**. How many do you think I mean by **each section**?
Sophie @ [2018-05-08T00:44:43.025Z]: Parts of the fence
Sophie @ [2018-05-08T00:45:09.252Z]: Four?
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T00:46:07.320Z]: I'm going to use red to show an example of **each section**. How many sections did I highlight in red?
Sophie @ [2018-05-08T00:46:30.123Z]: One
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T00:46:42.621Z]: Right! So **each** section means 1 out of 4. Do you see that?
Sophie @ [2018-05-08T00:47:01.640Z]: yes
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T00:47:14.184Z]: Great! What fraction can I use to show 1 out of 4?

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T15:32:37.862Z]: Hello! Let's say my yellow train is 6 ft and your blue train is 24 ft. How can I find how much longer your train is?
Arriyana @ [2018-05-10T15:33:07.065Z]: Multipcation?
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T15:33:18.715Z]: Can you say more about what you mean by that?
Arriyana @ [2018-05-10T15:34:39.535Z]: because 4x6 equal 24 right? \
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T15:36:03.491Z]: Right! So we can say your train is 4 **times** as long. Do you see that?
Arriyana @ [2018-05-10T15:36:27.815Z]: Yes
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T15:36:41.570Z]: Awesome! How can we find how much longer your train is now?
Arriyana @ [2018-05-10T15:38:05.992Z]: You can multiply 6x4? am i right :/ because that what i did and it said i wasn't
Arriyana @ [2018-05-10T15:38:22.944Z]: right
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T15:38:37.240Z]: That's how you find how much **times** as long yours is. But how can we find how much longer your train is?
Arriyana @ [2018-05-10T15:38:59.429Z]: Look at the two numbers
Arriyana @ [2018-05-10T15:39:17.855Z]: and add or subtract
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T15:39:34.835Z]: Which would help us find how much longer yours is if yours is 24 and mine is 6?
Arriyana @ [2018-05-10T15:39:59.953Z]: Then 24 is the biggest number
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T15:40:08.325Z]: That does not answer my question. Please read it again carefully :)
Arriyana @ [2018-05-10T15:40:48.476Z]: Subtraction
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T15:40:59.577Z]: How would we use subtraction to help us?
Arriyana @ [2018-05-10T15:41:54.432Z]: do 24-6 and that will show how much longer it is then 6
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-10T15:42:00.375Z]: Perfect! Do you think you can use what we talked about and apply it to your problem?

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T14:53:18.233Z]: Hi! Let's look over your problem again. Would you like me to type or talk?

Kunaal @ [2018-05-09T14:54:16.384Z]: i don't even know how to divide decimals
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T14:54:24.714Z]: Hello! What is one way we can divide a decimal?
Kunaal @ [2018-05-09T14:54:54.650Z]: do it like long division
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T14:55:21.495Z]: We could! Let's use an example on the board
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T14:55:35.707Z]: How can we show 2.25 ÷ 9?
Kunaal @ [2018-05-09T14:55:52.814Z]: what do you mean
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T14:56:18.071Z]: Let's think, how can you think of 2.25 as money?
Kunaal @ [2018-05-09T14:56:41.123Z]: 2 dollars and one quarter
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T14:57:11.034Z]: Awesome! Sometimes it helps to change a decimal to a whole number to help us divide, ok?
Kunaal @ [2018-05-09T14:57:29.185Z]: ok
Kunaal @ [2018-05-09T14:58:01.396Z]: but having a quarter is not a whole
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T14:58:06.050Z]: So how many pennies would I need to show $2.25?
Kunaal @ [2018-05-09T14:58:15.126Z]: 225
Kunaal @ [2018-05-09T14:58:45.278Z]: oh
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T14:58:53.978Z]: Exactly! So we can think of 2.25 as 225 pennies to help us divide. Does that make sense?
Kunaal @ [2018-05-09T14:58:55.193Z]: 225 is the whole
Kunaal @ [2018-05-09T14:59:01.863Z]: yes
Kunaal @ [2018-05-09T14:59:30.056Z]: so 225 divided by nine
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T14:59:32.148Z]: Awesome! Now how can I actually divide 225 and 9?
Kunaal @ [2018-05-09T15:00:02.294Z]: by long division
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T15:00:14.907Z]: Ok! can you show me on the board?
Kunaal @ [2018-05-09T15:00:41.223Z]: how
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T15:01:06.291Z]: You can draw on the board :)
Kunaal @ [2018-05-09T15:02:35.556Z]: 25
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T15:02:45.745Z]: Awesome work! So we have 25 pennies. How can you write 25 pennies as a decimal?
Kunaal @ [2018-05-09T15:03:08.137Z]: 2.5
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T15:03:38.555Z]: That would be 2 dollars and 50 cents.
Kunaal @ [2018-05-09T15:03:51.330Z]: opps 0.25
Kunaal @ [2018-05-09T15:03:55.560Z]: right
Kunaal @ [2018-05-09T15:04:04.961Z]: ??
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T15:04:19.460Z]: Awesome work! So 2.25 ÷ 9 = 0.25, do you see how we used whole numbers and money to help us find that?

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T17:40:05.358Z]: Let's use an example with 35 + 17. How can you break **each number** apart into tens and ones first?

JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:40:50.048Z]: 10 7

JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:41:27.189Z]: 3
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T17:41:42.226Z]: Yes! So i can say 3 tens and 5 ones, do you see that?
JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:41:43.918Z]: 17 is 10
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T17:41:55.531Z]: So i can say 3 tens and 5 ones, do you see that?
JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:42:27.036Z]: yes
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T17:42:44.870Z]: Awesome! So we have 3 tens and 5 ones and 1 ten and 7 ones. How can we find the total **ones** first?
JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:43:09.888Z]: add them together
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T17:43:28.790Z]: right! So how many total ones do we have?

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T17:45:02.175Z]: How can we add 5 + 7?
JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:45:41.649Z]: 7 + 5 = 12
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T17:46:18.090Z]: Awesome! so we have 12 ones. How can we find how many total **tens** we have?
JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:47:06.252Z]: 3 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5
JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:47:35.703Z]: because you bring the 1 from 12 on top of 3 and add
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T17:47:58.126Z]: Remember, we want to keep them separate :) So we have 12 total ones. How many total tens do we have?
JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:48:49.855Z]: 8 ones :)
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T17:49:05.451Z]: That does not answer my question. Please read it again carefully :)

Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:27:35.755Z]: sorry to bother
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:27:49.341Z]: um
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:28:32.613Z]: i know that one is greater and you can use stratigies
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:28:58.175Z]: Can you say more about what you mean by that?
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:29:59.424Z]: like 1/4 and 1/2 you comepare
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:30:52.157Z]: i will use the the butterfly method
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:31:17.561Z]: so 4 x1
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:31:20.383Z]: 4

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:31:46.314Z]: Ok, let's use a different strategy to help us! When we compare fractions, should we compare them to the **same size whole**?
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:32:19.982Z]: no
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:32:44.427Z]: How would you know which is greater then?
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:32:49.114Z]: because they're mostly different
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:33:22.516Z]: so yes
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:33:38.047Z]: oh i think i get it
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:33:49.070Z]: Ok!
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:33:50.698Z]: like divide
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:34:09.734Z]: the wholes by the denominator
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:34:29.333Z]: Ok, let's look at one of these charts to talk about

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:34:42.719Z]: How can we determine who ran further for this chart?
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:35:33.392Z]: make a circle and divide it into 3's
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:35:48.397Z]: same with the other
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:35:56.597Z]: First, how can you describe how far each person ran in your own wors?
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:35:58.245Z]: words*
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:36:44.802Z]: can i use the butterfly method
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:36:48.785Z]: please
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:37:21.208Z]: Please describe how far each person ran in your own words first :)
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:37:28.369Z]: ok
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:37:59.438Z]: ok
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:38:12.970Z]: Great!
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:39:29.018Z]: monhammad ran 2/3 same with desiree
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:40:13.376Z]: so if we can compare them they are the the same distants
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:41:17.034Z]: Ok! How did you find that they are the same?
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:43:15.140Z]: if you see the fractions they are the same
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:43:37.995Z]: If I said I ran 2/3 of five miles and you ran 2/3 of two miles, who ran further?
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:44:18.209Z]: you
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:44:22.568Z]: Why is that?
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:44:44.468Z]: because 5 miles are larger than 2
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:45:08.648Z]: even though you ran the same
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:45:29.892Z]: we
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:45:57.673Z]: ; ]
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:46:16.990Z]: Right! So it depends on the **total distance** too. Do you see that?
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:46:17.026Z]: [cannot do smile]
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:46:25.421Z]: ya
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:46:54.640Z]: Great! So for the chart I sent, how can you explain the total distance of each person?
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:47:14.695Z]: wait can i ask you something
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:47:35.153Z]: is a marathon larger than a sprint
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:47:54.128Z]: oh you can't

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:48:11.135Z]: What is the total distance for Mohammad?
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:48:39.857Z]: 2/3 of a mile
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:48:58.425Z]: Right! So what is the total distance for 'a mile'?
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:49:42.299Z]: 1
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:49:50.065Z]: or 3/3
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:50:02.470Z]: Right! 1 mile. What about the total distance of Desiree?
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:50:05.482Z]: 4/4 5/5
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:50:23.883Z]: 1 of a mile
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:50:38.416Z]: Exactly! So if they each ran 2/3 of 1 mile, how can we compare their distances?
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:50:51.135Z]: wait
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:52:16.194Z]: desireeran a mile and in 2nd mile he ran 2/3
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:52:23.215Z]: ran
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:52:35.998Z]: I'm not sure what you mean :)
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:52:53.178Z]: oh never mind
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:53:20.262Z]: what did you asked again
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:53:46.971Z]: So if they each ran 2/3 of 1 mile, how can we compare their distances?
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:54:34.490Z]: see if one ran 1 mile or more
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:55:05.540Z]: than the other
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:55:05.612Z]: Think about that again :) It is saying each person ran 2/3 OF 1 mile. How can we compare how much each person ran?
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:55:19.282Z]: you can't
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:55:29.285Z]: Compare means less than, greater than OR equal to :)
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:56:34.007Z]: they are = if there are no other information
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:57:01.690Z]: no to isn't
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:57:41.008Z]: Ok! Why would the distances they ran be equal/?
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:58:43.172Z]: because they are the same can i show you what i mean
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:59:16.064Z]: Awesome work! You are doing a great job! Time to work on your own. Please come back if you need more help.

EMERY @ [2018-05-09T13:35:48.892Z]: 4/4
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T13:35:56.243Z]: Right! So I can show 2 wholes as 4/4 + 4/4, do you see that?
EMERY @ [2018-05-09T13:36:31.870Z]: so an improper fraction is 8/4
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T13:36:49.572Z]: Awesome! So if we have 8/4 + 3/4, how can we combine those to make our total fraction?

Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T11:55:34.463Z]: Hi! Let's look over your problem again. Would you like me to type or talk?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T11:55:59.471Z]: HI LETS TYPE !!
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T11:56:14.747Z]: What information does the graph tell you?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T11:56:46.904Z]: it shows the price of the raisins box
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T11:57:04.745Z]: Ok, What else does it show?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T11:57:34.681Z]: the ounces
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T11:57:54.699Z]: Great! What does this problem ask you to find?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T11:58:48.373Z]: the smallest raisin box with the highest price
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T11:59:51.990Z]: Great! On the x-axis, if you move to the right of 0, what happens to the size of the box?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:00:09.259Z]: it gets bigger
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:01:20.403Z]: Great! What about when you move up from 0 on the y-axis?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:01:46.781Z]: it gets smaller
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:02:03.157Z]: Why do you say that?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:02:17.629Z]: because it the oppisite
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:02:36.478Z]: What do you mean by that?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:03:08.702Z]: because it the y axis and then the x axis
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:03:34.516Z]: let's look at that on the whiteboard
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:04:30.980Z]: Please use your pencil tool to label each of the tick marks on both axes
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:05:47.331Z]: how do i do that
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:06:27.300Z]: Hold down the left mouse button and draw the numbers.
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:07:04.461Z]: so what do i number it from
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:07:20.912Z]: That's what I want you to figure out
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:07:33.005Z]: There is a 0 where the 2 axes cross
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:07:35.919Z]: ohhhhhhh!!!
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:08:06.855Z]: How does 1, 2 and 3 come **before** )?
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:08:09.786Z]: 0
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:08:24.690Z]: its not letting me draw
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:08:35.322Z]: I turned it off
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:08:37.398Z]: and 0
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:08:48.279Z]: so How does 1, 2 and 3 come **before** 0?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:09:50.026Z]: i really dont know;(
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:10:09.353Z]: What has Ms Stern told you about number lines?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:11:40.480Z]: make it fair
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:11:51.351Z]: What happens to the numbers on a number line as you move from left to right?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:12:23.169Z]: they bigger and smaller.
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:12:47.520Z]: Why do you say they are 'bigger and smaller' as you move from left to right?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:13:56.230Z]: because if u go to the right it gets bigger with the numbers and if u go back u get smaller
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:14:26.940Z]: Ok so as you move from **Left** to **right** the numbers get bigger, not smaller. Does that make sense?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:14:47.745Z]: yes, a little
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:15:10.515Z]: Ok so what number should go on the 1st line to the **right** of 0?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:15:36.066Z]: 1
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:15:57.592Z]: Ok, what's next to that?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:16:04.353Z]: 2
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:16:20.223Z]: Great! What about the 1st line above 0?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:16:35.780Z]: 1 and 2
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:16:57.894Z]: no
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:17:04.774Z]: 3 and 4
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:17:37.319Z]: WHich? 1 , 2, 3, or 4?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:17:51.652Z]: 3 and 4
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:18:07.449Z]: Why do you say that 3 comes after 0?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:18:26.467Z]: it dosent
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:18:46.857Z]: Ok so what number goes on the line above 0 then?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:19:01.812Z]: 1
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:19:12.546Z]: Ok what about the line above that?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:19:18.151Z]: 2
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:19:41.230Z]: Great! So as you move up from 0 on the y-axis, what happens to the numbers?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:20:01.396Z]: they go up
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:20:12.674Z]: Great! Keep that in mind as you work through this problem. Please come back if you need more help. Have a nice day!

Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T18:22:38.584Z]: What are you doing when you estimate a number?

Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T18:23:22.880Z]: What do you mean that estimating means 'nearest thousand?'
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:24:07.609Z]: the problem is 2,057 round by the nerest  thousand?
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T18:24:33.321Z]: Ok so what do you know about **how** to round **any** number to the thousands?
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:25:09.555Z]: 2,000 or 3,00
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:25:16.439Z]: 3,000
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:25:46.085Z]: 3,000?
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:26:10.866Z]: is 3,000 the anser?
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T18:26:26.259Z]: What question of **mine** are you answering?
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:26:43.828Z]: the first one
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T18:27:00.959Z]: Which was what question exactly?
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:27:36.686Z]: Ok so what do you know about how to round any number to the thousands?
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:27:57.918Z]: that one
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T18:28:42.304Z]: Ok but what you said doe s not answer this question. Let me rephrase it
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T18:28:58.926Z]: How would you explain to your classmate how to round any number to the thousands?
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:29:23.241Z]: all i know is that you got to round to the 100s
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:29:35.868Z]: place some times
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T18:30:02.362Z]: What do you mean you 'round to the 100's' when you are rounding to the thousands?
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:31:13.642Z]: becase it is not rounded to the 1,00s if you dont round it to the 100s
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:31:22.350Z]: 1,000
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T18:32:00.962Z]: I don't understand what you mean. Let's take a look at an example together.
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:32:14.365Z]: ok
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T18:32:18.738Z]: If you round 2,345 to the **thousands**, what do you get?
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:32:29.228Z]: 3,000
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:32:32.873Z]: ?
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T18:32:44.735Z]: How did you get that?
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:33:15.274Z]: becase the 100 is 300
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:33:32.921Z]: so that makes it 3,000
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T18:33:43.171Z]: Ok so how does that tell you that 2,345 becomes 3000?
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:34:12.972Z]: the 3 in 2,345 i9s the anser
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:34:31.802Z]: so it makes it 3,000
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T18:34:38.241Z]: Let's look at this more closely. What does it mean to round a number?
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:35:43.079Z]: to show how it is closser to one number or a differnt number
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T18:36:26.535Z]: Great! Since we are rounding to the thousands,  Skip count by 1000 in the chat box until you have 5 numbers
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:37:06.537Z]: 2,000
Lillian @ [2018-05-08T18:37:10.402Z]: ?
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T18:37:26.695Z]: Why did you start at 2000?

Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T16:25:43.082Z]: What does the denominator of **any** fraction tell you?
JAELYN @ [2018-05-08T16:26:20.420Z]: the total number of pieces?
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T16:26:54.792Z]: Great! What does the numerator of **any** fraction tell you?
JAELYN @ [2018-05-08T16:27:20.696Z]: how many pieces are shaded or filled in?
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T16:27:46.363Z]: Great! Let's take a look at an example together.
JAELYN @ [2018-05-08T16:28:10.350Z]: ok
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T16:28:44.763Z]: What denominator would you use for the rectangle on the left?
JAELYN @ [2018-05-08T16:28:47.166Z]: 4/4?
JAELYN @ [2018-05-08T16:29:31.202Z]: 1?
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T16:29:54.653Z]: Great! Soo what fraction would you use to represent **both** rectangles together then?
JAELYN @ [2018-05-08T16:30:31.157Z]: um i dont know
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T16:31:11.898Z]: What did **you** say a denominator tells you?
JAELYN @ [2018-05-08T16:31:28.086Z]: the total number of pieces
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T16:31:54.436Z]: Total number of pieces in what?
JAELYN @ [2018-05-08T16:32:05.959Z]: the fraction?
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T16:32:33.293Z]: What do you maen by that?
JAELYN @ [2018-05-08T16:33:35.241Z]: the total number of pieces in a circle,trapezoid ect
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T16:34:04.840Z]: Ok so thinking about that, what denominator would you use in my example then?
JAELYN @ [2018-05-08T16:35:11.308Z]: the total number of pieces in a fraction
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T16:35:26.611Z]: So what **nubmer** is that?
JAELYN @ [2018-05-08T16:36:25.041Z]: you there?
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T16:36:50.927Z]: I was waiting for your answer. What **number** will you use for the denominator then?
JAELYN @ [2018-05-08T16:37:05.838Z]: uh 4?
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T16:37:36.505Z]: Great! So what fraction reprents all the shaded parts then?
JAELYN @ [2018-05-08T16:38:01.221Z]: 4/4?
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T16:38:21.396Z]: How did you get 4/4 for all the shaded parts in the picture on the whiteboard/
JAELYN @ [2018-05-08T16:39:41.123Z]: because the drawing shows 4 pieces that or shaded so its also 1 whole
JAELYN @ [2018-05-08T16:39:58.571Z]: is*
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T16:40:07.640Z]: Do you see that there are 2 rectangles in my picture?

Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T16:42:00.633Z]: Great! So what fraction reprents all the shaded parts then?
JAELYN @ [2018-05-08T16:42:02.251Z]: my friend typed that
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T16:42:15.866Z]: Great! So what fraction reprents all the shaded parts then?
JAELYN @ [2018-05-08T16:42:50.509Z]: 4/4
JAELYN @ [2018-05-08T16:42:55.891Z]: ?
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T16:43:18.810Z]: How many total shaded parts are in those 2 rectangles?
JAELYN @ [2018-05-08T16:43:36.515Z]: 8?
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T16:44:15.331Z]: Ok so will 8 be the numerator **or** the denominator of the fraction?
JAELYN @ [2018-05-08T16:44:37.071Z]: denominator?
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T16:44:46.997Z]: Why do you say that?
JAELYN @ [2018-05-08T16:45:06.343Z]: because thats the total amount of pieces?
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T16:45:43.906Z]: Ok but is that the total shaded pieces, the total pieces in one whole thing or the total unshaded pieces?
JAELYN @ [2018-05-08T16:46:21.173Z]: huh? I dont understand
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T16:46:47.747Z]: Is 8  the total shaded pieces, the total pieces in one whole thing or the total unshaded pieces?
JAELYN @ [2018-05-08T16:47:47.935Z]: i tryed it and got the anwser rightso i think I got it!
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-08T16:48:00.422Z]: Ok but do you understand it?

Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-05-10T13:26:45.862Z]: What strategy would you use to compare 3/4 and 5/6?
Raelyn @ [2018-05-10T13:28:26.966Z]: hmm...maybe number line
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-05-10T13:28:33.561Z]: excellent!
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-05-10T13:28:36.739Z]: please show me your thinking in the whiteboard, okay?

Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-05-10T13:30:59.222Z]: And what about 3/4? :)

Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-05-10T13:31:34.349Z]: So then 3/4 is ____ than 5/6
Raelyn @ [2018-05-10T13:32:18.781Z]: I think 3/4 is maybe smaller than 5/6
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-05-10T13:32:26.547Z]: it sure is!
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-05-10T13:32:49.103Z]: let's compare them based on the size of the part you took away from 1.
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-05-10T13:33:12.459Z]: is 1/4 larger or smaller than 1/6? :)
Raelyn @ [2018-05-10T13:34:53.241Z]: you can erase what i drew so you can have enough space

Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-05-09T15:40:37.848Z]: What strategy would you use to find the missing numbers?
Callie @ [2018-05-09T15:40:54.365Z]: divison ?
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-05-09T15:41:23.501Z]: excellent!
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-05-09T15:41:26.260Z]: why do you think that strategy would work?
Callie @ [2018-05-09T15:42:48.613Z]: because you can find the missing number by dividing it by the number you already have. To be honest Mrs.Audrey im not for sure if this works i had to take a good guess.
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-05-09T15:43:06.396Z]: perfect!
Callie @ [2018-05-09T15:43:23.528Z]: so it was correct?

Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-05-09T15:44:49.086Z]: what could you divide to find n for **n x 3/4 = 5/2**?

Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-05-09T15:47:10.100Z]: 5/2 ÷  3/4 or 3/4 ÷  5/2?
Callie @ [2018-05-09T15:47:40.042Z]: 3/4 divided by 5/2 and you get 3/10

Callie @ [2018-05-09T15:48:31.262Z]: because if you do it the other way it comes out to be an improper fraction which is 10/

Mia @ [2018-05-09T19:21:48.123Z]: you divide by two?
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-09T19:22:35.820Z]: surface area of a sphere = ??? x ???
Mia @ [2018-05-09T19:23:27.511Z]: 8 times 3.14
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-09T19:23:43.494Z]: what unit it the sphere measured in?
Mia @ [2018-05-09T19:24:08.973Z]: ft
Mia @ [2018-05-09T19:24:17.974Z]: but want to be in inches
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-09T19:24:50.228Z]: exactly!!!! How can you convert feet to inches?
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-09T19:25:05.978Z]: That information in 2 HELP:)

Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-09T19:26:24.130Z]: 96, right?
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-09T19:26:52.275Z]: so if the diameter is 96, what is the radius?
Mia @ [2018-05-09T19:27:03.341Z]: sorry types it rong but yes 96 inches
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-09T19:27:10.028Z]: No worries!
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-09T19:27:17.838Z]: what is half of 96?
Mia @ [2018-05-09T19:27:30.645Z]: the radius is 48 inches
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-09T19:28:27.251Z]: yes! so now we have 48(inches)²
Mia @ [2018-05-09T19:28:42.340Z]: yes
Mia @ [2018-05-09T19:28:45.235Z]: yes

Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-09T19:30:56.936Z]: what did we say the radius is?
Mia @ [2018-05-09T19:31:09.005Z]: 96 inches
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-09T19:31:21.391Z]: radius is half of diameter/
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-09T19:31:29.782Z]: and half of 96?
Mia @ [2018-05-09T19:31:36.660Z]: is 48
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-09T19:32:10.198Z]: yes!
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-09T19:32:23.322Z]: 48 inches = 4 feet. Still with me?
Mia @ [2018-05-09T19:32:29.811Z]: yeah
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-09T19:33:54.353Z]: Using the formula, we now have SA = 4π • 48(inches)²
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-09T19:34:16.280Z]: So now you can use that to calculate the surface area:)
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-09T19:34:38.309Z]: See if you can use what we did to try this on your own.
Mrs. Cheryl @ [2018-05-09T19:35:19.676Z]: Thank you for you hard work on this problem, Mia!
