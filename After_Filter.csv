Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:33:47.410Z]: Did you hear my voice?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:34:38.905Z]: what are factors?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:35:53.239Z]: yes, they are numbers like a first factor is the first number in a probem
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:36:18.381Z]: ok so what is the job of a factor?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:37:04.237Z]: do not understand
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:37:16.058Z]: Please look up words you are unfamiliar with in the glossary you have been provided. :)
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:37:22.777Z]: like factors :)
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:37:30.906Z]: i did
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:37:45.820Z]: ok so what did your definition say?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:39:32.347Z]: a whole number muitply by one or more whole number
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:39:50.589Z]: Fantastic thinking! yay!
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:40:06.780Z]: thx
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:40:26.658Z]: now can factors be prime, composite or both?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:44:31.290Z]: no because they are each different suff
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:44:57.143Z]: hi
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:45:01.335Z]: hello
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:45:03.903Z]: Can you say more about how you got that?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:45:05.108Z]: hi'
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:45:10.664Z]: ok
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:47:09.950Z]: they are because they each have different meaning
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:47:29.979Z]: ok so what is a prime number?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:48:52.648Z]: a whole with 2 factor
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:49:11.359Z]: not quite but you can look up what prime means
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:50:49.511Z]: i did
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:51:02.606Z]: ok so what is a prime number?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:53:07.633Z]: a whole number with two factors and 1 is not a prime number because it is only one number
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:53:20.967Z]: super!
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:53:49.599Z]: so lets compare numbers 1, 2 , and 4
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:53:59.856Z]: how many factors make up the 1?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:55:24.709Z]: 0
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:56:31.191Z]: well remember what factors are: 2 numbers multiplied to get a product
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:56:49.332Z]: 1
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:57:33.972Z]: ok so really 1 has a factor 1  and itself right?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:57:42.333Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:58:14.570Z]: ok so what kind of number is 1
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:58:55.733Z]: not a prime numbers
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T00:59:21.095Z]: ok can you explain not?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T00:59:58.115Z]: i mean it is not a prime number
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:00:31.317Z]: Fantastic thinking! 1 is unique so it is not considered a prime number. what other numbers are prime?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:00:58.410Z]: 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:01:43.484Z]: Not quite, but good effort! Let's work together to figure this out.
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:01:59.079Z]: lets establish some clarifications
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:02:21.894Z]: wait 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:04:30.345Z]: ok so how are you getting these numbers? what is your reasoning?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:06:21.333Z]: because it says 1 is not a prime number
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:06:49.697Z]: ok but we need to know why :)
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:07:25.899Z]: so what are the factors of 2?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:08:20.628Z]: 1
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:09:04.481Z]: 2 x 1 = 2
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:09:11.331Z]: are there any other factors of 2?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:09:25.925Z]: 2
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:09:54.017Z]: ok what other factor goes with 2 ?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:10:14.156Z]: 4
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:11:05.037Z]: so you are saying that there is 4 x ? = 2
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:11:26.841Z]: n0
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:11:44.432Z]: ok so the only true factors of 2 are 2x1
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:11:51.994Z]: does that make sense?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:12:05.549Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:12:21.016Z]: so lets categorize it on the whiteboard
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:12:33.614Z]: what about 3
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:12:43.703Z]: what factors when multiplied = 3?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:13:37.995Z]: do not have one
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:14:09.865Z]: what do you mean by that?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:14:49.666Z]: i do not have a answer
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:15:09.167Z]: ok so you still dont know what factors are do you?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:15:14.989Z]: you can be honest
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:16:09.751Z]: i do not what they are
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:16:39.042Z]: ok lets use an example on the white board
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:16:47.324Z]: ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:16:58.579Z]: what number do you see?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:16:58.591Z]: 8
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:17:04.182Z]: great!
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:17:10.766Z]: 4 2
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:17:14.296Z]: 8 is the product or the answer to a multiplication problem
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:17:34.012Z]: the 4 and 2 are the factors
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:17:44.912Z]: o
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:18:13.057Z]: ok so
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:18:27.877Z]: now we can also classify numbers into two groups
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:18:35.803Z]: do they have it in eyery problem
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:18:55.105Z]: yes every NUMBER can be either composite or prime
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:18:59.471Z]: does that make sense
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:19:11.999Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:20:08.526Z]: ok so now are there any other factos for 8?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:20:31.469Z]: 4 2 2 4
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:21:01.054Z]: yes but essentially they are the same numbers right?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:21:05.298Z]: how about 8x1
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:21:24.655Z]: yea
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:22:13.414Z]: ok so because eight has 2 pairs of factors it is COMPOSITE
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:22:22.182Z]: does that make sense?
Jenelle @ [2018-05-09T01:23:14.140Z]: yes thank you have a great night

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T21:02:09.888Z]: ok so what is happening in the diagram?
Melany @ [2018-05-08T21:02:48.979Z]: it is counting by two
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T21:03:04.458Z]: super! Can you say more about how you got that?
Melany @ [2018-05-08T21:04:09.810Z]: i can see the numbers and on top it has a two with a plus sigh
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T21:05:30.658Z]: super so what do you think would come after 8 based on the pattern?

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:23:26.965Z]: lets type
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:23:31.462Z]: ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:23:35.359Z]: how can i help?
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:24:35.111Z]: i dont know exactly how to get the answer for the last problem 4/6=blank then i have to fill in the blank
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:24:49.459Z]: oh ok
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:24:55.302Z]: and it has to be in fraction form
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:25:26.633Z]: so how did you think about the others you got correcT&gt;
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:26:35.298Z]: it gave me one of the numbers so  i figured out how they got it and the way i thought they got the other number i used to get the number i needded
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:27:05.164Z]: Way to pay attention to those clues!
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:27:23.556Z]: so now in the last one, what can help you regarding the denominator?
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:28:32.465Z]: it didnt give me any numbers thats why  need  help cause i dont know what to multiply by
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:29:00.946Z]: ok so lets make some observations based on the other equivalent fractions
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:29:16.759Z]: for example
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:29:22.213Z]: Do you see the whiteboard?
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:29:49.905Z]: yess
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:30:03.566Z]: how are 3 and 6 similar?
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:30:21.208Z]: you multiply by 2??
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:31:00.187Z]: yes! perfect! so 6 is part of the 3 multiple family
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:31:22.825Z]: yep
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:32:02.078Z]: one observation is that in order to have equivalent fractions, the numerators have to share a common multiple
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:32:06.545Z]: does that make sense?
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:32:38.037Z]: kinda could you explain a little more please
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:32:41.859Z]: sure
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:33:06.004Z]: thank you
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:33:26.579Z]: the green numbers are all multiples
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:33:38.993Z]: do you see that?
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:34:10.876Z]: yes and the red numbers are what you multiplying by right
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:34:45.684Z]: well the red number is the number family
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:35:01.053Z]: it is what you are skip counting by
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:35:07.114Z]: oh
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:35:18.166Z]: 3,6,9,12,
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:35:31.948Z]: then what comes next if we are skip counting by 3?
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:35:55.493Z]: 15,18,21,24,27
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:36:09.202Z]: Fantastic thinking! those multiples could go on and on!
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:36:29.509Z]: now when we compare fractions the numerators have to share a common multiple
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:36:39.546Z]: which we decided was 6
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:37:19.016Z]: would we multiply by 6 then
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:37:22.628Z]: are you with me?
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:37:33.597Z]: yepp
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:37:41.616Z]: well how did you think about multiplying by six?
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:38:55.361Z]: cause  both 3 and 6 have a multiple of 6
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:39:34.007Z]: ok i see! but actually we would find the factor that would could use to relate the two numbers
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:40:02.401Z]: what do u mean by relate
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:40:16.588Z]: what numbers 3 x ? = 6
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:40:24.152Z]: 2
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:40:37.572Z]: super that is called the common factor
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:40:48.723Z]: oh ok.
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:41:13.303Z]: so what we do to the NUMERATOR with the common factor we have to also do to the DENOMINATOR
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:41:52.218Z]: And thats a way we can get equivalent fractions
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:41:53.753Z]: find common factors ?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:42:10.207Z]: well common multiples
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:42:27.297Z]: then fill in the factors to make the equation true
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:42:49.479Z]: so lets try the bottom one and walk me thru it
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:43:26.538Z]: whats your first thought?
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:44:36.686Z]: i honestly  cant remember much after like 5 minutes thats why i need extra help in math cause i have difficulties understanding it
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:44:49.218Z]: Please give it a try! It is okay to make mistakes.
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:45:19.158Z]: would we multily by 2
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:45:26.749Z]: ***multiply
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:45:59.705Z]: ok so essentially we would just be doubling the fraction right when we multiply by 2 right?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:46:07.985Z]: we can do that :)
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:46:21.329Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T03:46:40.283Z]: so we have to do the same to the top
RILEY @ [2018-05-09T03:46:46.683Z]: 8/12

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:26:34.892Z]: what is Adian needing to know?
IBRAHIM @ [2018-05-09T01:27:18.554Z]: How far from the library is the park
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:28:14.504Z]: yes so how can we start thinking about this problem?
IBRAHIM @ [2018-05-09T01:28:49.704Z]: I don't know
IBRAHIM @ [2018-05-09T01:29:49.791Z]: Divide?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:30:08.155Z]: ok why do you say divide?
IBRAHIM @ [2018-05-09T01:31:26.917Z]: because you subtract  293.8 and 308.2 then divide 308.2 and 2?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:31:55.826Z]: not quite actually there is no dividing involved but there is finding the difference
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:32:08.811Z]: so we have two facts of information
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:32:14.388Z]: reading 1 and reading 2
IBRAHIM @ [2018-05-09T01:32:39.413Z]: ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:33:41.279Z]: so you said we would subtract right?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:33:47.948Z]: how did you reason that?
IBRAHIM @ [2018-05-09T01:34:02.337Z]: you add 293.8 and 2.3 then subtract that from 308.2
IBRAHIM @ [2018-05-09T01:34:36.825Z]: because 308.2 is the total
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:36:58.731Z]: reading 1 + reading 2 = 308.2
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:37:05.886Z]: is that what you are saying?
IBRAHIM @ [2018-05-09T01:37:34.231Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:38:02.552Z]: ok so lets plug it in
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:39:09.218Z]: does that make sense?

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:40:16.723Z]: thats the distance from the library to the park

Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:24:34.650Z]: Well i know that right now its 6 but if you add 2 on each of the other sides the total is 10?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:24:51.847Z]: Fantastic thinking!
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:24:56.745Z]: :)
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:25:04.636Z]: you figured it out!!
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:25:12.385Z]: so the answer is 2
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:25:22.999Z]: ?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:25:40.044Z]: yes and how would you use it in a perimeter equation?
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:26:14.525Z]: 6+2=10 perimeter?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:26:27.158Z]: 6+2=8
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:26:38.316Z]: yeah thats what i meant sorry
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:26:42.854Z]: rememeber the formula for perimeter?
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:26:49.163Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:26:54.984Z]: what is it?
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:27:25.760Z]: it would be 3+2=5 and then again 3+2=5 so 5+5=10?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:28:01.572Z]: yes exactly
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:28:12.373Z]: ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:28:14.893Z]: 2 x length + 2 x width = perimeter
Emily @ [2018-05-11T02:28:22.985Z]: Yeah
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:28:39.356Z]: so 2 ( 3) + 2 ( 2) = 10

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:55:55.351Z]: ok thats the area but not the ratio
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:55:59.142Z]: ok Let's take a look at an example together.
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:57:11.045Z]: so lets say the smaller square is 1/2 scale drawing of the orginial and bigger figure
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:57:39.986Z]: that means the smaller square is 1/2 smaller than the bigger one
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:57:56.406Z]: or the bigger square is twice as big as the small one
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:58:01.241Z]: does that make sense?
Daniel @ [2018-05-09T01:58:05.311Z]: Yes
Daniel @ [2018-05-09T01:58:48.367Z]: That means the smaller square is half the size as the bigger
Daniel @ [2018-05-09T01:59:03.196Z]: whih means the smaller square is 2
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:59:03.917Z]: ok so how can we figure out the length of the smaller square! and yes thats right
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:59:07.322Z]: Fantastic thinking!
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:59:42.422Z]: how did you get 2 by the way?
Daniel @ [2018-05-09T02:00:49.718Z]: Because 4 divided by 1/2 is 2 because i already knew half of four is two
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T02:01:02.746Z]: nice! so you divided :)
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T02:01:11.679Z]: so what would be the width?

Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:00:14.287Z]: type
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:00:38.109Z]: ok so what is the equation of  a circle?

Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:01:22.045Z]: i think
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:01:51.935Z]: how did you find that equation?

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:02:53.938Z]: ok so what equation is described in the problem?

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:04:55.369Z]: ok great! so the question asks which of the given choices represents the SAME x^2+y^2-4x+2y=4?

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:59:40.986Z]: ok so what do we know about the dimensions?
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:00:18.197Z]: that there is 2 types of dimensions 3d and 2d
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:00:38.550Z]: yes and the dimensions can also mean measurements

Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:01:12.034Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:01:49.936Z]: ok so we know the measurements in the given diagram right?
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:02:07.428Z]: yea
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:02:08.835Z]: i think it would easier to see in an example so Let's take a look at an example together.
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:03:37.964Z]: so the red square is 1/2 the scale of the white square
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:03:42.428Z]: are you with me?
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:03:46.971Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:04:19.899Z]: and how can i prove that with the measurements given?
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:04:47.393Z]: by multiplying?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:05:13.640Z]: ok can you say more about that?
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:05:32.718Z]: and by dividing?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:06:39.262Z]: thats a start!
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:07:00.129Z]: so just by looking at the lengths, how do they compare?
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:07:53.960Z]: 4 is a multiple of 2
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:08:03.067Z]: 10 is a multiple of 5
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:08:47.858Z]: yes and we also that 5 is half of 10 right
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:08:55.905Z]: and 2 is half of 4
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:09:07.121Z]: so the scale proportion is 1/2
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:09:18.123Z]: we can prove this mathematically too!
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:09:27.819Z]: yes
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:09:56.924Z]: so that means that the red shape is half of the white one
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:10:19.198Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:10:31.111Z]: and 1/2 is the scale proportion
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:11:03.012Z]: so when the problem shares the word 'scale' it means what proportion of the orginial it is
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:11:11.771Z]: does that make sense?
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:11:24.140Z]: kinda
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:11:40.888Z]: ok so lets switch the numbers a little
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:11:46.052Z]: 1/2 was kinda easy
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:11:53.877Z]: ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:12:19.372Z]: lets say the red square is 1/3 of the white square
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T02:12:39.803Z]: so i need to know what is 1/3 of the dimensions then correct?
Alexandra @ [2018-05-11T02:13:00.831Z]: yes

Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:20:23.395Z]: ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:20:30.024Z]: so what do you understand?
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:20:46.242Z]: understand about what
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:20:55.320Z]: the problem ??
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:21:14.788Z]: how far did you get with the other teacher?
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:21:47.720Z]: we didn't even go far, she barely helped me
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:22:05.185Z]: Her name is Mrs.B
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:22:25.013Z]: Hello
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:22:29.996Z]: ok sorry to hear that again
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:22:34.004Z]: What do you already know that might be useful here?
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:23:37.874Z]: I don't know anything,i just wanted help from the other teacher, but can you help
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:24:15.127Z]: i bet u do!  so  are we estimating in this problem?
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:24:27.021Z]: yes I think
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:25:12.830Z]: and how do you know that?
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:25:44.603Z]: because they have one same number
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:25:58.690Z]: ok what are they?
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:26:03.466Z]: 3 • 25 = 75
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:26:08.588Z]: 75 ÷ 25 = 3
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:26:18.834Z]: they both have 25
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:26:53.634Z]: super! so there is a connection between 25, 3 and 75
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:27:07.981Z]: yes!!:)
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:28:03.509Z]: so what happens when we take one hundredth of 75?
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:28:13.889Z]: what do u mean?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:28:48.803Z]: ok one moment let me show you
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:29:10.024Z]: ok:)

Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:29:30.134Z]: thats confusing lol
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:29:50.595Z]: yeah it can be but lets focus on the first step
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:30:10.857Z]: ok
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:30:20.796Z]: whats the first step
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:30:33.594Z]: so what are they doing inthe first step? hold on one moment
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:30:57.187Z]: ok:)

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:31:17.158Z]: highlighted part
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:32:37.853Z]: it says 3 times 25(0.1)=75(0.1)
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:33:29.759Z]: yes so on the left side when we multiply 25 x (0.1) =?
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:34:12.520Z]: =2.5
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:34:31.898Z]: super!
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:34:46.489Z]: :)
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-09T01:35:03.927Z]: so we know multiplying a number by 1/10 moves the decimal point one place to the left
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:35:26.662Z]: I guess
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:36:00.124Z]: I am not a 100% sure if I get this
Caroline @ [2018-05-09T01:36:50.963Z]: hello

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T21:03:52.525Z]: So are you saying  you would across the numerators?
Elijah @ [2018-05-08T21:04:11.851Z]: Yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T21:04:36.905Z]: so what about the denominators?

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T21:05:43.478Z]: ok so do the denominators have to be the same?
Elijah @ [2018-05-08T21:05:53.236Z]: Like the numerator is 21 but I don't know how to find the denominator
Elijah @ [2018-05-08T21:06:03.607Z]: Yes they do
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T21:06:21.105Z]: do you know how we can find the common denominators?

Elijah @ [2018-05-08T21:12:10.019Z]: I added the numerators and the biggest denominator
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-08T21:13:25.047Z]: ok well in order to find the common denominator we have to find a common multiple for both

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:02:26.707Z]: ok What do you already know that might be useful here?
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:02:58.312Z]: what?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:03:14.072Z]: what do you already know that can help you?
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:03:57.894Z]: ummm
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:04:07.503Z]: It is okay if you do not know! We can work together to find out.
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:04:27.438Z]: that it gives us the kind of fractions
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:05:37.417Z]: yes it does
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:06:02.233Z]: so what do you have to change the mixed numbers to?
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:06:25.458Z]: i dont know
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:07:13.162Z]: It really helps to read or listen to the problem carefully. Are you able to do that?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:07:19.371Z]: It tells you :)
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:08:58.776Z]: i know but how do i change a mixed # into a fraction
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:09:40.416Z]: ok Let's take a look at an example together.
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:10:26.020Z]: O:D
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:11:18.938Z]: ok:-)
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:13:18.601Z]: so do you understand this is mixed fraction?
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:13:29.781Z]: yes i think
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:14:42.930Z]: ok so what comes to mind when making this a fraction?
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:14:42.938Z]: can you let me show you what it equals
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:14:50.336Z]: sure
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:15:42.338Z]: there
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:16:02.515Z]: Not quite, but good effort! Let's work together to figure this out.
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:16:08.077Z]: ok
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:16:42.830Z]: so what do we do?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:17:22.275Z]: first we have to multiple the denominator with the whole number
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:17:26.171Z]: its gonna be 15
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:17:40.003Z]: yes i know this part
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:17:44.744Z]: super!
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:17:56.407Z]: so how did you get that?
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:18:19.344Z]: i got 15/10 becouse
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:19:01.438Z]: i multiply 1 and 10 wich equals 10 +5 equels 15
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:19:20.224Z]: and we leave the denominator the same
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:19:23.392Z]: super!
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:20:36.064Z]: so how can you apply this strategy with this problem
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:22:07.116Z]: i just dont know on the problem what mixed number im suppose to turn into a fraction.
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:22:47.035Z]: well first you have to identify the mixed numbers
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:22:52.854Z]: so lets look at the first one
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:22:59.709Z]: ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:23:01.713Z]: what is the mixed number?
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:23:32.958Z]: 2 3/12
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:25:06.153Z]: 2 3/12 right
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:25:16.577Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:25:46.459Z]: so how would you make it into a fraction like you just showed me?
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:25:53.319Z]: the total is going to be 27/12
Veronica @ [2018-05-11T01:25:58.999Z]: right

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:16:31.245Z]: ok so do you remember the standard form?
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:16:34.309Z]: oops didn't mean to send that

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:17:34.201Z]: have you seen the math help?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:17:40.795Z]: it gives a great example!
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:18:25.248Z]: wayyy to confusing

Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:21:19.738Z]: so lets walk through this step by step
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:21:40.662Z]: what does the first statement mean to u?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:22:03.775Z]: Make the statement in simple words :)
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:22:07.472Z]: Numbers
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:22:10.871Z]: nothing
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:22:34.552Z]: I don't see how I can relate that to an equation of a circle
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:24:07.982Z]: ok well in the example they give you, they want you to know what a standard form of the equation looks like
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:24:56.863Z]: meaning that within this equation you find the center of the circle and the radius
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:24:56.916Z]: ohh looking at two different things
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:25:12.492Z]: ok can you say more about that?
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:25:42.397Z]: I was looking at where it says example. That equation.
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:25:52.514Z]: oh ok
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:26:03.551Z]: yes but the statement above it is also helpful
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:26:20.345Z]: no they take the Example equation and they start to break it down
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:26:24.051Z]: what do they do first?
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:27:09.109Z]: I have no clue... Where did the 9 come from?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:27:36.999Z]: good question about the 9! lets think about this
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:27:52.763Z]: what does it mean to complete the square?
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:28:52.127Z]: to like answer it?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:29:14.570Z]: yes
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:29:40.535Z]: but there's no 3
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:31:28.115Z]: so why would you need a 3? show me on the whiteboard
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:32:10.039Z]: because if you complete the square to get 9 you need a 3
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:33:52.095Z]: yes but remember that x^2 is the same as what?
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:34:06.372Z]: yes
Ms. Johana  @ [2018-05-11T01:34:45.693Z]: but when you complete the square, what do you get?
Haley @ [2018-05-11T01:35:15.322Z]: I don't know what x is

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:01:01.826Z]: Right, what does a denominator *(the bottom of a fraction)* tell us about a whole object?
Evolet @ [2018-05-08T15:01:51.382Z]: how many total pieces there are
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:02:18.948Z]: Right! :) for example, how many equal parts would 3/4 have in 1 whole?
Evolet @ [2018-05-08T15:02:52.448Z]: 4
Evolet @ [2018-05-08T15:02:58.389Z]: ???
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:03:09.441Z]: Great! :) So if we have the fraction 8/4... how many wholes is that?

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:07:10.423Z]: 8/4... the 4 is how many part make up 1 whole... what does the 8 mean?
Evolet @ [2018-05-08T15:07:35.832Z]: the number of equal parts
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:07:53.714Z]: That is how many parts we have right?
Evolet @ [2018-05-08T15:08:01.577Z]: yes
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-08T15:09:03.935Z]: So if we have 8 total parts... and we know to have 1 whole, we need 4 parts, how many wholes can we make?

ASHER @ [2018-05-10T00:59:25.923Z]: Dividing the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same number will have an equivalent fraction

ASHER @ [2018-05-10T01:00:09.817Z]: 1 whole.
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-10T01:00:17.189Z]: So then if we have 6/8 ÷ 1, we can say that the value of the fraction does **not** change. Right?
ASHER @ [2018-05-10T01:00:39.603Z]: Yeah.
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-10T01:00:45.627Z]: We can also say that since we know the 2/2 = 1, that 6/8 ÷ 2/2  also does **not** change the value of the fraction. Make sense? :).

Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:39:58.898Z]: And 4/4 is 1 whole.... what fraction is the same as 2 whoels?
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:40:00.701Z]: wholes*
Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:41:18.794Z]: ummmmmmmm...
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:41:46.527Z]: Please give it a try! It is okay to make mistakes.

Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:42:10.683Z]: I don’t know
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:42:23.941Z]: Do you see that **8**/4 would be the same as 2 wholes?
Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:42:33.677Z]: No
Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:42:41.468Z]: How
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:43:30.955Z]: the 4 tells us how many parts will make up 1 whole. So **4**/4 tells us we have 4 parts out of 4 parts... good so far?
Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:44:34.912Z]: Oh I get it because 4+4=8 two wholes would be 8/4
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:44:59.820Z]: Right! :)
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:45:05.025Z]: So then is 9/4 more or less than 8/4?
Paige @ [2018-05-09T21:45:33.182Z]: More so it is bigger than two wholes
Ms. Meaghan @ [2018-05-09T21:46:12.958Z]: Right! :) So now find out how many acres we still need in lot 5 to get to a total of 3 acres :)

Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T18:58:33.569Z]: What does a denominator tell us about our whole amount?
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T18:58:45.120Z]: ummm
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T18:58:54.961Z]: whatt
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T18:59:02.725Z]: do you mean
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T18:59:03.764Z]: Can you please shade half of this?
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T18:59:10.498Z]: halh\
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T18:59:13.967Z]: halh
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T18:59:17.128Z]: half
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T18:59:18.967Z]: i mean
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T18:59:21.100Z]: me
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T18:59:28.874Z]: okay get readyy
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T18:59:30.440Z]: okay
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T18:59:44.174Z]: ready :)
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T18:59:51.850Z]: okay
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:00:20.219Z]: right :)  a denominator will tell us how many equal parts our whole is split into. Since our whole is split into 2 equal parts, our denominator has to be a 2.
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:01:38.317Z]: Let's try another example.  Please shade 2/8 for me
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:01:54.143Z]: okay
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:03:56.838Z]: If we had 2/8 used twice, would there be another way to solve it instead of repeated addition?
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:04:07.078Z]: ummmmm
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:04:17.624Z]: yeah what you are doing
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:04:24.588Z]: the smae thing
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:04:35.371Z]: and can you shade the boxes really fast
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:04:42.133Z]: and why is it blue
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:05:23.257Z]: ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:05:37.698Z]: If we wanted to use something other than repeated addition, what would we do?  Addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division?
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:06:08.960Z]: for example, if I had  2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10, would there be another way to solve it instead of repeated addition?
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:06:27.401Z]: wait can you answer my qustion
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:06:29.152Z]: plz
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:06:30.365Z]: plz
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:06:57.992Z]: can you shade the boxes really fast and why is it blue
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:07:03.188Z]: Yes, :)  the teachers have colors we can choose from
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:07:16.759Z]: oh can you put red i want to see it
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:07:27.938Z]: i never see it on think trought math
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:07:35.344Z]: through math i mean
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:07:51.225Z]: okay let get started
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:07:58.709Z]: Did you see my question above? for example, if I had 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10, would there be another way to solve it instead of repeated addition?
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:08:11.385Z]: yes
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:08:32.192Z]: Great, what could we do instead?
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:08:50.297Z]: you could Multiple
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:09:10.778Z]: perfect strategy :)

Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:09:54.246Z]: i dont get it still
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:10:05.374Z]: now im more confuse
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:10:18.291Z]: so weird
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:10:46.229Z]: i dont get this that much bc i dont know how you got 2
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:10:51.508Z]: WHen you told me 2 x 5... how did you get the 5 ?
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:11:19.175Z]: wow thats just so rude
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:11:37.294Z]: I would like to help you. Are you ready to work on this together?
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:12:03.472Z]: i do to but not like you told i just fell like i just got rusted
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:12:41.266Z]: You're doing fine, let's just use what you told me to see how I got mine.  When we had 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 we said it was 2 x 5... where did the 5 come from?
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:14:10.121Z]: yeah but were did you get the 2 from
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:14:48.766Z]: The same way you got the 5 :)  when we adding two for 5 times, we multiply 2 x **5**.  In my example, how many times are we adding 2/8 ?
Darrell @ [2018-05-09T19:16:00.972Z]: no im  talkingy babo0u6t the4 5
Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-09T19:17:56.518Z]: I'm not sure I understand that, can you explain your thinking to me?

Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-10T20:08:04.662Z]: :) absolutely! it works the same in math... dependent qualities need something else to make sense and independent make sense on their own

Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-10T20:12:52.165Z]: If I say I have 5 apples, does it depend on anything else to find it (like finding the price did) ?

Mrs. Kathryn @ [2018-05-10T20:13:35.473Z]: You're right, so just a single number, (the number of apples) is independent... it doesn't need anything else to find it
Sabella @ [2018-05-10T20:14:22.996Z]: ok

David @ [2018-05-10T14:21:25.757Z]: yes! ?
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:21:32.501Z]: Well what does regrouping mean?
David @ [2018-05-10T14:23:17.560Z]: hum,to,....?
David @ [2018-05-10T14:23:49.312Z]: I don't know:(
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:23:58.855Z]: Regrouping is the same as 'borrowing'
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:24:05.710Z]: Do you have to borrow to do 3-2 ?
David @ [2018-05-10T14:24:24.925Z]: no...
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:24:46.466Z]: that's right, so we just have 3-2 = 1 in the first box
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:24:55.390Z]: Now look at the tens place: 2 - ☐ = 6 ?
David @ [2018-05-10T14:26:04.220Z]: nothing = to 2- enethang
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:26:35.668Z]: So since 2 is *less than 6* what do we have to do to solve that?
David @ [2018-05-10T14:26:55.075Z]: BARWO
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:27:22.610Z]: Yes, so after we borrow, what do we write above the 2 ?
David @ [2018-05-10T14:28:26.653Z]: a,hum,a 3
David @ [2018-05-10T14:28:32.222Z]: ?
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:28:36.918Z]: Well we regroup 1 hundred into 10 tens
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:28:40.778Z]: What is 10 tens + 2 tens?
David @ [2018-05-10T14:29:04.164Z]: 30?
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:29:18.825Z]: what is 10 + 2 ?
David @ [2018-05-10T14:29:26.267Z]: 12
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:29:59.708Z]: Right, so after we regroup we write 12 above the 2 .... Does that make sense?
David @ [2018-05-10T14:30:39.110Z]: yes, :(
Ms. Dominique @ [2018-05-10T14:31:40.565Z]: So 12 - ☐ = 6 ?
David @ [2018-05-10T14:32:25.185Z]: 12-5=6
David @ [2018-05-10T14:32:30.548Z]: 5

Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T17:24:18.356Z]: So if you multiply by a fraction less than 1... you get just a part of that number
Mrs. Amy @ [2018-05-09T17:24:20.890Z]: 1/2 x 6 = 3

Mariyah @ [2018-05-09T17:26:13.431Z]: More.

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T17:40:05.358Z]: Let's use an example with 35 + 17. How can you break **each number** apart into tens and ones first?
JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:40:46.638Z]: 30 5
JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:40:50.048Z]: 10 7
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T17:41:15.244Z]: Perfect! How many tens are in 30?
JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:41:19.158Z]: 35 is 30 and 5
JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:41:27.189Z]: 3
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T17:41:42.226Z]: Yes! So i can say 3 tens and 5 ones, do you see that?
JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:41:43.918Z]: 17 is 10
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T17:41:55.531Z]: So i can say 3 tens and 5 ones, do you see that?
JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:42:27.036Z]: yes
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T17:42:44.870Z]: Awesome! So we have 3 tens and 5 ones and 1 ten and 7 ones. How can we find the total **ones** first?
JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:43:09.888Z]: add them together
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T17:43:28.790Z]: right! So how many total ones do we have?
JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:43:34.054Z]: see i don't know how to do it im never going to get it right
JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:43:45.467Z]: 4
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T17:44:02.164Z]: If we have 5 ones and 7 ones, what is our total if we're adding?
JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:44:41.682Z]: 52
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T17:45:02.175Z]: How can we add 5 + 7?
JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:45:41.649Z]: 7 + 5 = 12
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T17:46:18.090Z]: Awesome! so we have 12 ones. How can we find how many total **tens** we have?
JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:47:06.252Z]: 3 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5
JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:47:35.703Z]: because you bring the 1 from 12 on top of 3 and add
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T17:47:58.126Z]: Remember, we want to keep them separate :) So we have 12 total ones. How many total tens do we have?
JALISA @ [2018-05-09T17:48:49.855Z]: 8 ones :)
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-09T17:49:05.451Z]: That does not answer my question. Please read it again carefully :)

Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:40:13.376Z]: so if we can compare them they are the the same distants
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:41:17.034Z]: Ok! How did you find that they are the same?
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:43:15.140Z]: if you see the fractions they are the same
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:43:37.995Z]: If I said I ran 2/3 of five miles and you ran 2/3 of two miles, who ran further?
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:44:18.209Z]: you
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:44:22.568Z]: Why is that?
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:44:44.468Z]: because 5 miles are larger than 2
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:45:08.648Z]: even though you ran the same

Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:49:50.065Z]: or 3/3

Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:50:23.883Z]: 1 of a mile
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:50:38.416Z]: Exactly! So if they each ran 2/3 of 1 mile, how can we compare their distances?
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:50:51.135Z]: wait
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:52:16.194Z]: desireeran a mile and in 2nd mile he ran 2/3

Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:53:46.971Z]: So if they each ran 2/3 of 1 mile, how can we compare their distances?
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:54:34.490Z]: see if one ran 1 mile or more
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:55:05.540Z]: than the other
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:55:05.612Z]: Think about that again :) It is saying each person ran 2/3 OF 1 mile. How can we compare how much each person ran?
Elizabeth @ [2018-05-08T14:55:19.282Z]: you can't
Mrs. Lynae @ [2018-05-08T14:55:29.285Z]: Compare means less than, greater than OR equal to :)

Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T11:59:51.990Z]: Great! On the x-axis, if you move to the right of 0, what happens to the size of the box?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:00:09.259Z]: it gets bigger
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:01:20.403Z]: Great! What about when you move up from 0 on the y-axis?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:01:46.781Z]: it gets smaller
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:02:03.157Z]: Why do you say that?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:02:17.629Z]: because it the oppisite
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:02:36.478Z]: What do you mean by that?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:03:08.702Z]: because it the y axis and then the x axis
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:03:34.516Z]: let's look at that on the whiteboard
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:04:30.980Z]: Please use your pencil tool to label each of the tick marks on both axes
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:05:47.331Z]: how do i do that
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:06:27.300Z]: Hold down the left mouse button and draw the numbers.
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:07:04.461Z]: so what do i number it from
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:07:20.912Z]: That's what I want you to figure out
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:07:33.005Z]: There is a 0 where the 2 axes cross
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:07:35.919Z]: ohhhhhhh!!!
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:08:06.855Z]: How does 1, 2 and 3 come **before** )?
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:08:09.786Z]: 0
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:08:24.690Z]: its not letting me draw
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:08:35.322Z]: I turned it off
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:08:37.398Z]: and 0
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:08:48.279Z]: so How does 1, 2 and 3 come **before** 0?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:09:50.026Z]: i really dont know;(
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:10:09.353Z]: What has Ms Stern told you about number lines?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:11:40.480Z]: make it fair
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:11:51.351Z]: What happens to the numbers on a number line as you move from left to right?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:12:23.169Z]: they bigger and smaller.
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:12:47.520Z]: Why do you say they are 'bigger and smaller' as you move from left to right?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:13:56.230Z]: because if u go to the right it gets bigger with the numbers and if u go back u get smaller
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:14:26.940Z]: Ok so as you move from **Left** to **right** the numbers get bigger, not smaller. Does that make sense?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:14:47.745Z]: yes, a little
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:15:10.515Z]: Ok so what number should go on the 1st line to the **right** of 0?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:15:36.066Z]: 1
Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:15:57.592Z]: Ok, what's next to that?

Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:16:20.223Z]: Great! What about the 1st line above 0?
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:16:35.780Z]: 1 and 2
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:16:57.894Z]: no
Jayvyon @ [2018-05-09T12:17:04.774Z]: 3 and 4

Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:18:07.449Z]: Why do you say that 3 comes after 0?

Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:18:46.857Z]: Ok so what number goes on the line above 0 then?

Ms. Caren @ [2018-05-09T12:19:41.230Z]: Great! So as you move up from 0 on the y-axis, what happens to the numbers?

Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-05-09T15:41:26.260Z]: why do you think that strategy would work?
Callie @ [2018-05-09T15:42:48.613Z]: because you can find the missing number by dividing it by the number you already have. To be honest Mrs.Audrey im not for sure if this works i had to take a good guess.
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-05-09T15:43:06.396Z]: perfect!

Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-05-09T15:47:01.837Z]: brilliant!
Mrs. Audrey @ [2018-05-09T15:47:10.100Z]: 5/2 ÷  3/4 or 3/4 ÷  5/2?
Callie @ [2018-05-09T15:47:40.042Z]: 3/4 divided by 5/2 and you get 3/10
